He is everywhere and He is nowhere: in a flash He may show, “Yes, I am here”, yet, when we are earnestly searching for Him, He may be nowhere to be found. His nature is independent.

We should try to serve Him through His devotees, without expectation of any reward. We should have no desire except to serve, even without expecting to see Him once, to have His darśan. We shall only want to be utilised by Him. The little energy we have must be utilised for His cause. We are His potency and we should prove that we belong to Him. Mahāprabhu says, “He may embrace Me or reject Me, or He may even be indifferent towards Me. Whatever He likes, He may do, but I have no alternative but to serve Him.” We must adopt such an exclusive and unconditional attitude. Not that, “If He doesn’t want to reciprocate according to my will, I won’t like to approach Him; so I shall join the atheists or the māyāvādīs. If You don’t come forward to satisfy me, then I shall seek my own way—I don’t want You!” If there is any tinge of such an attitude, we are far, far away."},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Yathā tathā vā vidadhātu lampaṭo, mat-prāṇa-nāthas tu sa eva nāparaḥ</span>: “We have no alternative but to serve You.” To search means to serve: “I want to be utilised for His cause.

A true devotee thinks, “There is no obligation to anyone except one, and He is my Lord, Kṛṣṇa.” And His most laudable and greatest servitors are those who are in contact with His greatest agent. Not His direct contact, but contact with the greatest agent of His service will constitute the safer and higher relationship of ananya-bhajan, exclusive service eliminating all else."},{"class":"b44","text":" No trace of exploitation should be traced in us. We should not run after any type of enjoyment including even the enjoyment of ‘God-association’. We must be fully purged of the enjoying spirit. If a trace of enjoyment remains in us, we shall have to remain in one of the planes of this brahmāṇḍa, this universe, such as Bhūr, Bhuvar, Svar, Mahar, Janas, Tapas, and Satyaloka. And if any tinge of renunciation or retiring spirit is in us, we will not be allowed to enter into the world of infinity, Vaikuṇṭha. <span class=\\"e3\\">Kuṇṭha</span> means ‘limitation’, and <span class=\\"e3\\">Vaikuṇṭha</span> means the unlimited world. We want to be a member of the infinite world. ‘Finite’ only refers to the attempt of our separate interest to measure the infinite, and thereby, we conceive of finite. When our ego wants to measure a portion of the infinite, considering, “This is my kingdom, that is my friend’s kingdom, etc.”, then whatever we see with our separate interest is māyā—misconception and misunderstanding in the infinite. All such things must be dissolved. And the attitude of retirement, “If I can’t enjoy, I shall stop work; I shall go on strike”—that type of reactionary mentality must also be abandoned."},{"class":"b51","text":" Then, we shall be face-to-face with the positive side only. What is the positive side? It is the wave from the centre, līlā, the play of the Absolute. That wave is fulfilling the desire of the Supreme Lord, and we will be face-to-face with that. If the tendency for separate interest or reactionary retirement remains in us, we cannot have a touch of that eternal flow to satisfy the Absolute. When we are free from these two kinds of whims, we can come into connection with the eternal flow where all points, everywhere, are active to satisfy the centre. Such a plane is not dry; it is happy, constructive, and nourishing, and that, we shall be able to feel. Only a small touch of it will make us understand that we do not want a particle of anything else. This is our homeward journey, and any other want or demand will keep us in a foreign country filled with death, disease, infirmity, rebirth—all these troubles. These troubles all occur because of misconception and identification of the soul with mortal things."},{"class":"b59","text":" bhukti-mukti-spṛhā yāvat piśāchī hṛdi vartate<br />tāvad bhakti-sukhasyātra katham abhyudayo bhavet"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu: Pūrva-vibhāga, 2.22)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “How can the joy of holy devotion appear in the heart as long as it is haunted by the ghosts of desire for exploitation and renunciation?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" These two ideas of renunciation and enjoyment are foreign to us.

Yet, devotion is so rarely to be found, we may not expect that we have attained it (sudurlabha, ibid.). In one word, when we say that we have some devotion, we are not in devotion. Rather, when we can feel that we have nothing, although we have no aspiration for any other thing, at that point we may be making some progress. We do genuinely want something, although we can’t clearly understand what, but we appreciate the devotees and the divine scriptures of devotion. When our appreciation is on that side, yet we feel we are bereft, that is a sober and healthy position. So vacant.

The science is very subtle and not known to anyone and everyone, yet we cannot deny its existence. It has its tangible position. But faith is much more subtle, and through it one can establish both higher contact and reciprocation. Subtle faith is not approachable by anyone and everyone; it has its tangible existence and it may function in any circumstance if we have its peculiar contact. We cannot give false statements that we possess it; our power and grandeur are not necessarily any proof of its presence in us. Despite great pomp and show, all we personify may be falsehood. We should be very cautious to maintain our contact with genuine faith."},{"class":"b44","text":" Of course, sincerity is the main requirement for faith’s connection. No price, however valuable in this world, can purchase it. The qualification is laulyam—our sincere and earnest desire for the thing. No one can purchase the Absolute, and no price can purchase Him. The absolute necessity is our sincere desire and earnestness. With insincerity, we cannot make trade with Him; He is not so foolish as to become an object of trade for anybody! Sincere desire for Him is required, and that will awaken the conception to serve Him. We want Him, sincerely—through affection. We love Him, so we desire Him. And to love means to sacrifice for the object of our love."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Jīva Goswāmī Prabhu has given a beautiful definition of the word ‘Bhagavān’.<span class=\\"e3\\"> Bhajanīya sarva-sad-guṇa-viśiṣṭa</span>: “The Supreme Lord, Bhagavān, is of such nature that everyone who comes in contact with Him will want to serve Him and to sacrifice themselves for His satisfaction.” This is the result of faith in its developed form. He is so noble; we shall think that if we die to satisfy Him, our life’s objective will be fulfilled. His noble quality is such that it draws so much sacrificing spirit for Him; it draws everything towards Him. “Die to live.” Faith is such."},{"class":"b44","text":" We are in the ocean of faith, and the devotees are the essential agents. Each helps the other. We are much relieved from the fatigue and trials of a long journey if we have a companion or the association of a group. Similarly, in this ocean, if we obtain the help of devotees of similar nature to ours, that will be most conducive. Even our Guru Mahārāj, in a speech he delivered on Vyāsa Pūjā, his Holy Appearance Day, addressed his disciples, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Vipada-uddhāraṇa-bandhu-gaṇa</span>: Oh my friends, who can give me relief from danger."},{"class":"b44","text":" “To me, you are my deliverers from danger. In the ocean of faith, it is very difficult to journey onward alone, so you have come to help me in my dangerous, ambitious journey in the infinite. You have come, and you are engaging me in talking about only Him, and so, you have given me some engagement. Otherwise, to live and move alone in the infinite is very difficult, troublesome, and dangerous. You have all come to hear something, and in this exchange of talks about Him the situation has been made very safe and easy to journey so far toward Vaikuṇṭha.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" We must be conscious of our real position when we are searching for Kṛṣṇa. It is not easy, and also, it is very easy—both simultaneously. Faith is the only capital by which we can make our journey towards the Infinite. Bhakti, devotion, has no beginning and no end (<span class=\\"e3\\">ahaituky apratihatā</span>). There is no beginning—it is there already. Before we came to know about it, it was there. It was there, it is there, it will be there. No one can resist it—that bhakti, that faith, is irresistible. It is part of the eternal substance. Its very nature is eternity—none can oppose it. We only have to make contact and associate with it, and the wave will carry us towards our goal. And if we can have the company of the devotees, the journey becomes very easy and pleasant, whereas to go alone is very difficult."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the progress of our contact with faith, when we come to take benefit from devotees and have faith in them, we are more safe and our progress is also tangible—it comes to reality. From a vague, abstract position, faith becomes deeper within us. We can then recognise many others with the same objective in life, and the journey becomes easier. It becomes conceivable. It comes into measurement. When we have faith in the real devotees, we can come into contact with such a tangible thing."},{"class":"b44","text":" Thus, the position of the devotees is very important in our journey, especially in the middle stage. In the primary stage, not much importance is given to the devotees. With only a vague conception from the scriptures and with the help of previous accumulated merits (sukṛti), the journey is begun. But gradually, the beginners find that to journey onwards in the infinite is not an easy thing: “We thought that with a little progress we could attain the desired end, but now we find that it is not so.” When we come to consider the real position of devotion, of what is God—He is universal, He is the ultimate goal—we may gradually become disappointed. But if along the way we take help from the devotees of similar objective, we shall feel much relief by their company, even though the destination may be far away. The difficulties of the journey are more prominent in the second stage. In the primary stage, we are not very exclusive in our objective, and so, we do not experience much difficulty. Real difficulties begin when we enter into the journey exclusively, with no other objective than to engage our whole energy towards that high and elevated path. And if we actually achieve a touch of the highest stage, the mahābhāgavat stage, the journey again becomes easier. But the middle portion is difficult, and at that stage the devotees are very important to save us. This is the period of both tangible acquisition and difficulty; our failings on the path to realisation are to be rectified in this middle stage."},{"class":"b44","text":" When we enter into war, in the beginning we have much hope. We feel confident. But the real test is when the fighting begins. And when we finally conquer, we again become very satisfied. But the middle—when the war is being conducted—that is the difficult period. At that time, our co-workers, our comrades who fight alongside us, are very, very important to us. “I am not alone, but there are many others battling alongside me in that middle fighting period of war.” Those companions are important. Some may disappear from the field, but there will be others to encourage me."},{"class":"b44","text":" Similarly, on this journey, we may see that many stalwarts are falling. It may discourage us to see such respected persons going away—falling in the middle path. Nonetheless, in the midst of those unfavorable circumstances there are others who are bravely making progress with unflinching faith, and they will help us. To stick it out to the end is difficult—but important and valuable. The test comes and shows how much faith we have. Nothing comes in vain, and we must take everything that happens in that way."},{"class":"b44","text":" There may be so many stalwarts, like Bhīṣma and Droṇa, who fall flat in the battlefield, but still we must go on (<span class=\\"e3\\">karmaṇy evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadāchana</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Bg</span>: 2.47). We are out to fight to the end. We must achieve our end of life, and we can imbibe such firmness from the character of the devotees. The śāstra will also offer helpful advice, but the association of the devotees is nonetheless of ultimate importance."},{"class":"b44","text":" We need lasting faith, not flickering faith: “Oh, I attempted for some time but I did not find any tangible fruit from bhakti, so I left”; or, “To me, it seemed very, very vague. When I began, I thought this to be something tangible that I would quickly attain, but it is not so. It is uncertain. I am giving so much energy for the cause, but still the desired result is not achieved.” Previous tendencies also draw from the negative side, and so we find that many stalwarts are falling."},{"class":"b44","text":" Still, we have to persevere in this journey, and we shall have to take courage from those who are standing and who are deeply engaged. Though it is told hundreds of times that the Absolute is infinite, in the beginning we still tend to take it in the conception of the finite. We are accustomed to think of anything and everything in terms of finite. So, although we hear that it is infinite—it is Vaikuṇṭha, it has no limit—we nonetheless cannot grasp the proper meaning. But when we make practical progress, many new conceptions must come to our knowledge."},{"class":"b51","text":" Now, when our Guru Mahārāj addressed his disciples as <span class=\\"e3\\">vipada uddhāraṇa bandhu-gaṇa</span>: “My dear friends who have come to deliver me from danger”, we should, of course, recognise such a statement from both the relative and absolute standpoints. Students are a necessary part of a professor. When a professor has students, he feels the practical utility of his life has been successful. Thus, from the relative point of view, disciples can help the Āchārya. But from the absolute standpoint, Kṛṣṇa’s will is everything, and the nitya-siddha or eternally perfect great souls who inwardly know the Lord’s intentions cannot be disturbed by any danger in any respect, but outwardly such an appearance may be manifest in their dealings."},{"class":"b59","text":" mach-chittā mad-gata-prāṇā bodhayantaḥ parasparam<br />kathayantaś cha māṁ nityaṁ tuṣyanti cha ramanti cha"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā: 10.9)"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Mach-chittā</span>: “Their attention is in Me”; <span class=\\"e3\\">Mad-gata-prāṇā</span>: “Their energy is also spent for My cause”; <span class=\\"e3\\">bodhayantaḥ parasparam</span>: “They mutually assist one another.” This reminds us of the ‘Napoleonic chair’.

In sambandha-rūpā the Lord’s associates cooperate according to their fixed relative positions of dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya, or madhura, whereas in kāma-rūpā they come forward to serve any necessity that is demanded of them.

But if a Vaiṣṇava orders us to read, our reading will be in devotion.” Even reading of the scriptures is not devotion unless done on the order of the Vaiṣṇava; independent reading is only knowledge-seeking.

Prahlād Mahārāj has been accepted as the basis, the beginning of pure devotion, śuddha-bhakti, in peacefulness or śānta-rasa. Hanumān is above that, in servitorship, or dāsya-rasa. Above that are the Pāṇḍavas in friendship or sakhya-rasa. And Uddhava is somewhat in friendship, connecting with parenthood, vātsalya-rasa, and consorthood, madhura-rasa. In this way, adherence in devotion for Kṛṣṇa automatically flows towards Vṛndāvan. The acme is in Vṛndāvan.

They are not creators of the mantras in the Vedas; they are only seers and feelers of spiritual current; they are only observers. The knowledge that is contained in the śruti (Vedas) is not created by anyone or anything. It is eternal and flowing. The ṛṣis are onlookers and recorders. And that śruti has come to reveal the fundamental truth underlying the whole creation; still, they are only inquisitive of something. They are enquiring about something. What that thing is, they do not know. They are only searching for the highest revelation that ever came down in the world. They are only searching for that reality, but they have not yet come into its connection. And this is Kṛṣṇa-bhakti and Vraja-bhakti—loving devotion for Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvan. And Mahāprabhu and <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> came with the quality of that type of adherence to the truth: unconditional surrender, adherence, searching, and serving attitude, seeking such fortune of serving the truth. That higher type of truth and existence is such that if we can be only a seeker after it, we may consider ourselves to be possessors of the highest fortune. We can really post ourselves in the path leading to that highest truth."},{"class":"b44","text":" That quality is the very basis and the degree of self-surrender (ātma-nivedanam). Whatever beautiful and valuable things we come across, we cannot but surrender ourselves to them. That is the criterion. If we come across anything higher within our vicinity, our appreciation means surrendering ourselves unto that. So according to the degree of our surrender, we have to measure what degree of quality of truth we have come across. That can be measured only according to the degree and intensity of surrender, or how much we could surrender to what we came into connection with, to the point of no return. And the true devotees know no satisfaction or fulfilment of feeling that “I have it.” They feel no trace of such satisfaction that “I have achieved.” Never. The inner sweetness of the truth and its infinite characteristic is such. It attracts. It can attract to the highest degree and magnitude. When some of the brāhmaṇs performing sacrifices wanted their wives to attend the yajña, some of the ladies were on their way to see Kṛṣṇa at the time. One brāhmaṇ came and forcibly opposed this. He stopped his wife, “No! I will not allow you to see Kṛṣṇa.” He stopped her body, but the life expired. The dead body remained there. She felt so much attraction to have a darśan, a divine glimpse, of Kṛṣṇa. Immediately, a lifeless body stood there; the life vanished."},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa is Beauty—Reality the Beautiful. Beauty absorbs us. The māyāvādīs, the impersonalists, say that the Brahma absorbs the individual soul so much that no trace of it remains. But this is an artificial conception of absorption. In the real conception of absorption, the existence of the seer of the truth is not done away with. He remains but he is absorbed with life. He is so absorbed and attracted that he becomes one. Even maintaining his separate existence, he is always one, full of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the highest degree, and this is visible to the world outside. The ‘oneness’ of the māyāvādīs is of course crossed in the beginning. <span class=\\"e3\\">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śochati na kāṅkṣati, samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu</span>: “I am one with Brahma”—that stage is surpassed, and then—<span class=\\"e3\\">mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām</span>, devotion is attained. There is oneness in divine attraction, union, and separation, in different līlā or Pastimes. To maintain the setting of līlā, the līlā is maintained. Here, complete absorption and oneness does not mean that everything is annihilated. Līlā is also eternal; the Lord’s Nām (Name), Rūpa (Form, beauty), Guṇa (qualities), Parikar (Entourage), Līlā (Pastimes) all are eternal. His relationship is a dynamic thing, not a static one. There is even union in separation. There is unity in every stage.

When our appreciation for śaraṇāgati comes, we will realise that we have come into the relativity of a great substance. Otherwise, one cannot find the necessity of śaraṇāgati at all. “Why śaraṇāgati? We want mastery over everything!” Modern science, the exploitationists, the karmīs—they want everything under their control. But this is just the opposite and opposite to the highest degree. In this, we shall find such a great and noble aspect of nature that we will voluntarily offer ourselves to be the eternal servant of it. “I am in the relativity of such a magnanimous, noble thing! Śaraṇāgati, herself, is reality. She contains Kṛṣṇa within her boundary. Come to śaraṇāgati, and you will find Kṛṣṇa. The halo of Kṛṣṇa is śaraṇāgati. Through śaraṇāgati you can approach the Kṛṣṇa conception, but not by enquiry. Not by barren enquiry, but sincere and substantial enquiry—and that requires śaraṇāgati. Praṇipāt, paripraśna, and sevā. Praṇipāt: first you must give exclusive respect to Him. If you want to approach Him at all the first qualification is praṇipāt: you must surrender. We are approaching a great thing, great in the infinite. And then, there is paripraśna, enquiry, to a certain extent. And then service—to be utilised by Him. To serve means to taste the juice. Only by serving can we connect, feel, and have any experience. This is just the opposite of enjoyment and indifference. Enjoyment, indifference—and service. And there is service as duty, and service as love—loving service. Thus, service is generally of two kinds. Service from the standpoint of duty is found in Vaikuṇṭha. Of course, that also fetches something. But service in love, service actuated through love only, is most amply giving. That gives us amply. And there is also a gradation therein—śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya, madhura. This is reality. In this material world, in the world of ‘enjoyment’, we also find the most intense enjoyment in lady-love, but this is the perverted reflection of reality. But there in the divine plane, in devotional service, divine consorthood is found in madhura-rasa. There also, in that section of devotees, there are gradations of servitors."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Rāmānuja sampradāya (divine succession founded by Śrī Rāmānuja Āchārya) divided into two, the Teṅkalai and Vaḍakalai sections. Vaḍakalai refers to those who give more importance to the Vedic scriptures, and Teṅkalai are those who give stress to the Tamil scriptures. They are known as Ālwārs, beginning from Śaṭhakopar or Nammālwār. In the process of surrender, the Tamilian school lay stress on mārjāra-nyāya, or the maxim of the cat. <span class=\\"e3\\">Mārjāra</span> means ‘cat’. In the cat’s dealing with her kitten, the kitten does not do anything, whereas the mother catches the kitten’s neck in her teeth and moves it here and there, wherever she likes. The kitten is passive; no attempt can be seen on its part. He simply accepts whatever the mother does. She feeds him, moves him, etc. This is mārjāra-nyāya. The Vedic school, which was headed by Deśik Āchārya, favour the markaṭa-nyāya, the maxim of the monkey. The cub catches hold of the mother’s body, and then the mother wanders and moves the cub here and there. But the beauty of the cub is to clasp the mother’s body. So the Vedic school says, “You have free will, O jīva-soul; you have something to do. In śaraṇāgati, you have your part to play. It may be very small, but still you have some part to play. You are endowed with free will, so you must properly utilise your free will.” And in the Teṅkalai system they say, “No, we have nothing to do. We only need to think that we are His, and He will do whatever is necessary on our behalf.” This is the difference between the two schools. The Vedic school holds that some action for free will is necessary. Your pure acceptance and consent is necessary, and the rest will be done by the Lord. But your consent or free will of acceptance, however meagre it may be, must be present. This is pure consent. And the Teṅkalai section hold that we have nothing to do."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our consideration is nearer to this Vaḍakalai school, the Vedic school. The jīva has something to do in the way of cooperation or consent. Otherwise, how can the jīva be a part of the Absolute? If the jīva has nothing to do, then everything is God’s līlā, spontaneous Pastimes, and the jīvas are all dolls of play in the hand of the Lord. No doubt, this may be so in the highest stage of realisation. But that stage is yet to be attained. In the beginning, one has to acquire such a position. Because the jīva is part of the subjective world, he is naturally endowed with freedom. There can be no consciousness without freedom. Because he is an infinitesimal particle, his freedom is also very small; still, because he is spirit, he cannot but possess free will. In divine service, that freedom is maintained; otherwise, vilās, freedom of movement in Pastimes, cannot be maintained. In Goloka, everyone is mostly actuated by feeling, by Yogamāyā (internal divine potency); they are actuated by love, but still they have their meagre personal consideration, and that is influenced by the all-good and favourable environment of the divine plane. Otherwise, how would they maintain their particular name, pastime, and service? So individuality in the atomic energy is maintained all through. We do not deny the influence of the environment, but the environment cannot devour the personal character of existence of anything and everything."},{"class":"b51","text":" Of exploitation and renunciation (bhukti and mukti), renunciation is more dangerous, because it holds a greater position than exploitation. It can exploit more, just as half-truth is more dangerous than falsehood. It can misguide the devotees more. It has its own special glamour, over and above exploitation. It can capture the scholars. One who wants relief can think, “Oh, this is the conception of relief; there is no further.” Renunciation captures those who may have been making real progress towards their good and tells them, “Yes, you have come here; you have succeeded.” It captures them in the name of the higher plane. Renunciation holds some prestige over exploitation. People think, “Oh, that must be the highest goal.” So, in this way, half-truth is more dangerous than falsehood."},{"class":"b59","text":" se du ’yera madhye viṣayi tabu bhāla<br />māyāvādi-saṅga nāhi māgi kona kāla"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śaraṇāgati: 27.3)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “The association of a materialist is preferable to that of a māyāvādī.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" If the māyāvādī can make you enter into the cell of sāyujya-mukti, the liberation of merging with the Absolute, you are finished.

You have to be so broadminded and hopeful that such a higher entity exists. Your hope and faith will have to be of such a magnanimous type to enter that land. You will sign the bond, the contract: “I am going to accept eternal slavery! I want to enter that land!” You have to search your fortune and sign the bond of slavery: “The association there is so high that even as a slave I want that association.

None of this nasty life. “I shall always be alert that I may not be cheated in the land of so many cheats; here, I always have to be alert—I will be cheated, I will be cheated.” That is a nasty life. So we must enter into a life where there is automatically no cheating, no calculation, and no reasoning. All are good—all are busy to give you something. Here, we are suffering from the opposite. But there, everyone is promoting you in your progress, pushing you towards your highest fortune. Such a land is there. To become a slave there is really to become a master. Whoever tends most toward slavery will be held by all as the head! Just as in love of country. If a leader is most sacrificing, he naturally becomes the head of the party. Sacrificing is his qualification. Generally, men have faith in one who has sacrificed much for the country, and they take him as their leader. But here in the mundane world, love of country is only extended selfishness. They will fight with another country. Or, for humanitarianism they will fight with other minerals or the vegetable or the animal kingdom. They are constructing a great civilisation at the cost of the vegetable and mineral substances.

Śaraṇāgati will give everything. Śaraṇāgati is the most fundamental and basic substance in the devotional world. The whole structure of the devotional world is based on śaraṇāgati. Without śaraṇāgati there can be no real entrance into the domain of service. Śaraṇāgati is the very life and essence of devotion, so it must be present in all forms of services. Without śaraṇāgati, service will be mere imitation, mere lifeless activity, and not devotion proper. Śaraṇāgati is the first condition. Prahlād Mahārāj has said, <span class=\\"e3\\">manye tad etad akhilaṁ nigamasya satyaṁ, svātmārpaṇaṁ sva-suhṛdaḥ paramasya puṁsaḥ</span>: the whole gist of Vedic teachings is <span class=\\"e3\\">svātmārpaṇam</span>—to give and fully dedicate oneself to the Lord. To give oneself is the substance of all devotional activity. This is also stated by Śrī Śrīdhar Swāmīpād in his commentary of the nine basic devotional practices (śravaṇam, kīrtanam, Viṣṇoḥ, smaraṇam, etc.). If devotional hearing, chanting, etc., is already dedicated to Him, only then will it get recognition as devotion, bhakti. Otherwise, everything is bogus. If I hear to fulfil my mundane purpose, then it is no longer bhakti. If I perform kīrtan or speak Hari-kathā to make some money, then it will not be bhakti. “Whatever I shall do, it is for Him.” That sort of bond must first be ‘signed’, and then whatever will be done on that basis will be recognised as bhakti. This is the foundation of bhakti. Without śaraṇāgati, all attempts will be exploitation, renunciation, meditation (karma, jñān, yoga), anything but bhakti. “The result must always go to my Lord; I am His slave—nitya dās.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “I am wholly His servant, without any independence to keep my independent property.

So whenever we perform devotional hearing, chanting, remembering, with this feeling, that will be devotional activity. But if that is withdrawn, everything will go to hell. If the plank of the dancing stage is withdrawn, the whole show is gone. Therefore, with śaraṇāgati, self-dedication, devotion is possible. Only the activity of the man of dedicated self can be reckoned as bhakti. He does everything on behalf of Kṛṣṇa.

The common interest is solely in Him. Then only our service will be bhakti. Without that, everything is lost. Śaraṇāgati must be present in order to have living devotion; otherwise, hearing and chanting are only forms, not life. Therefore, śaraṇāgati means exclusive connection and identification with the interest of Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa is not directly seen by us, so we serve the Guru and the Vaiṣṇava who are dear to Him. According to the degree of our self-abnegation in self-surrender, we will be benefitted, and the specific characteristics of śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya, or madhura-rasa will develop, and there are also subdivisions within these rasas. In this way, the devotee will be properly located.

Surrender does not allow us to think, “Why have you shown grace to him and not to me?” This is anti-surrendering temperament. No calculation. “If You come to calculate, I have no hope; so if You can show me some grace—some causeless mercy—then I have that hope. I have come to this department of the Lord, by surrendering.

This is the thunderbolt from the blue! To become śaraṇāgata, to surrender, means to leave all prospects—to be so emptied—“I have no prospect”; to be fully emptied, and then to surrender. There cannot be the least application in the petition: surrender means a clean slate. Complete dependence upon Him means He can make or mar. I must admit my master’s right to make or mar.

To try to mark the bright side, the svarūp, and to try to ignore the apparent side. He instructed, “You try to speak something in praise of your friend, your apparent opponent.” The Guru’s order was given, and so the disciple had to speak something in praise. Necessity is the mother of invention; he had to dive deep into the bright side of the other person and try to bring that side out. Thereby, the Vaiṣṇava atmosphere of giving and taking was aroused and the apparent, māyik side was gradually ignored, disregarded, and dissipated. Something similar happens in kīrtan as well. Why is kīrtan so powerful? Because when we are requested to speak something, we cannot but utilise our best attention to speak. We have to assert our best ability in the attempt to gather the proper information to speak something about the Supreme Lord. So, also, in the case of the Vaiṣṇava, as in the case of the Lord, we must approach the svarūp, the inner side, the inner aspect, the bright side, and ignore the apparent side; and thereby we will thrive. There, the real mutual relationship will be aroused. Once a year in the Holy Dhām of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, it was the practice of our Guru Mahārāj to preside in a meeting under the banner of Viśva Vaiṣṇava Rāja Sabhā (Universal Assembly of the Topmost Pure Devotees), and there his method was such: “Try to praise the Vaiṣṇava.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" So, to appreciate the nobility of a Vaiṣṇava may be difficult, but if we can do so, we may have a chance to reach a standard of real devotion to a certain extent.

A director of a drama may order his actors, “You must say like this, and I shall oppose.” Līlā also is a movement to one point, harmoniously without any disturbance. This is līlā.

Sat-chit-ānandam: unassailable existence, self-consciousness, and fulfilment. It is fulfilment in itself. In Hegelian philosophy, unassailable existence is described as ‘by itself and for itself’. The conscious element in the middle has been suppressed in that philosophy. The Absolute Truth feels His self-consciousness. He feels that He exists. Stone existence may not feel its existence, but soul perceives his existence; he is chit or chetan—conscious. But his consciousness is not perfect. It has some want, some demand, some hankering for a higher life. Ānandam or rasa is beauty, harmony, love. That is the conception of the fullest integer: having existence, consciousness, and also fulfilment.

Wordsworth hinted at ‘eye-beauty’ and ‘ear-beauty’. In one poem Wordsworth described a girl of his dreams. He wrote that she was a village girl, and there was a brook alongside that village. He says that the jingling sound of the brook contributed to her beauty. Many scholars tried to give some interpretation to this conception, but one Bengali scholar, Harināth De, who was a master of thirty-two languages, gave the interpretation: ‘ear-beauty contributed to eye-beauty’. His explanation was very taking to me. The ear-beauty, the beautiful sound of the brook, added to the appearance of that girl; that means that ear-beauty, or sweet sound, contributed to eye-beauty. Eye-beauty, nose-beauty, touch-beauty, etc., all are ānandam, rasam, or beauty in the broadest sense."},{"class":"b51","text":" In another Upaniṣadic word, it is stated, satyam, śivam, sundaram. <span class=\\"e3\\">Śiva</span> means <span class=\\"e3\\">maṅgalam</span>.

Therefore, soul proper is śiva; but we see that the soul is vulnerable. Supersoul is beauty, sundaram. That is concrete reality as the independent and fullest representation of existence. All other existences are but partial representations of the Absolute. Sundaram is satisfaction; the soul is dissatisfied. And for stone there is no question of satisfaction; it possesses only mere existence. But soul is dissatisfied, even though he is an eternal unit of self-consciousness. The words <span class=\\"e3\\">Śiva</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Mṛtyuñjaya</span>, and <span class=\\"e3\\">Mahādev</span> mean ‘free from mortality or change; eternal’.

Not to speak of them, even liberation (mokṣa) from the present flickering hankering is not the goal, and this is the finding of the scholars. Mere liberation from the negative side is an artificial life. Life must have its fulfilment. Everything has its fulfilment and necessary position. It is not meant for nothing! Zero cannot be the conclusion of the whole existence. Infinite is the conclusion, not zero. So mere liberation—to remain as in a long, deep slumber—that is destructive and inconclusive.

Recognising him as a faithful stalwart preacher of the perfect precepts of Gauḍīya-Vaiṣṇavism, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād conferred upon him the name ‘Śrī Bhakti Rakṣak’, meaning, ‘Guardian of Devotion’; and further, echoing the statement of the great Vaiṣṇava preceptor Śrīla Jīva Goswāmī (who referred in his Sanskrit writings to the renowned <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> commentator, Śrī Śrīdhar Swāmīpād, as bhakti-eka-rakṣak, ‘supreme guardian of devotion’), Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād gave him the tridaṇḍa-sannyās title of ‘Śrīdhar’. Thus, he became Śrīmad Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Mahārāj. As a prominent preacher in the Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭh Mission, he travelled extensively throughout India and preached fluently in Bengali, Hindi, Sanskrit, and English, spreading the teachings of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu on mass levels in universities, public seminars, and saṅkīrtan festivals."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād also expressed high appreciation for Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s Sanskrit composition <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Bhakti Vinod Viraha Daśakam</span>, considering it an omen of assurance that the grand ideals and dignity of the Śrī Gauḍīya divine succession (sampradāya) would be perfectly upheld and preached by such a learned and sensitive devotee as Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj. And practically, as a testimony to this fact, just prior to Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur Prabhupād’s departure from this mortal world, Śrīla Prabhupād had Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj sing in his presence the holy prayer most venerated by the entire Śrī Gauḍīya—Vaiṣṇava community—<span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Rūpa-Mañjarī-pada, sei mora sampada</span>."},{"class":"b44","text":" After the passing of Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur Goswāmī Prabhupād, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s godbrothers, associates, and the public, naturally revered him as the seniormost representative of the Śrī Gauḍīya sampradāya, although Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj himself was more inclined to anonymity as a humble Vaiṣṇava. Nonetheless, by the call of divine duty and divine inspiration, he established the Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh at Śrī Nabadwīp Dhām, hinting in a short Sanskrit poem that the Maṭh—as a sanctuary where the holy message of his Gurudev, Śrī Rūpa, and Śrī Chaitanyadev was preached—would inevitably become renowned throughout the world amongst the sincere and pious seekers of unalloyed truth and divinity."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj is the composer of numerous classical prayers and commentaries in Sanskrit and Bengali. His works are hailed as gems of pure Vaiṣṇavism by scholars, philosophers, and devotees worldwide. He authored <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Śrī Prapanna-jīvanāmṛtam</span>, a Sanskrit devotional treatise on the subject of divine surrender, which has become a standard textbook for devotees everywhere."},{"class":"b44","text":" Upon reaching his eighties, not only Indians but persons from America, Europe, and the world over, became attracted by his teachings and personality. He was known as a pure saint of the most simple habits of living. He was respected and loved for his saintly simplicity, his affectionate nature and dealings; and he was revered by all, whether godbrothers, disciples, other devotees, or the general public, being unanimously venerated for his formidable encyclopedic command of the revealed scriptures and further for his unique and unprecedented style of casting newer and newer light upon the most internal philosophical and revelatory purports of pure Śrī Gauḍīya-Vaiṣṇava siddhānta."},{"class":"b44","text":" A vast library of his taped discourses has been compiled by his disciples, and from such recordings have been published the exquisite English books <span class=\\"e3\\">Search for Śrī Kṛṣṇa—Reality the Beautiful</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Guru and His Grace</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">The Golden Volcano of Divine Love</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Loving Search for the Lost Servant</span>, as well as his unique commentary and interpretation of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā: The Hidden Treasure of the Sweet Absolute</span>, and many others. Many more publications are also anticipated."},{"class":"b44","text":" On 12th August, 1988, His Divine Grace Śrī Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj departed from this world, to enter into the eternal Pastimes. His departure did not herald the departure of one of the great stars of the Śrī Gauḍīya firmament, but that of the moon itself. Even the earth herself trembled on two occasions, forecasting and punctuating the event. A divine temple, named ‘The Temple of Union in Separation’, will be erected at his holy shrine at Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh, Nabadwīp, and worship will continue throughout the generations."},{"class":"b51","text":" Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj selected his most intimate and senior sannyāsī disciple, Śrīmad Swāmī Bhakti Sundar Govinda Mahārāj, as his successor, blessing him with the position of Āchārya-President of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh and all its affiliated branches. His Holiness Śrīmad Bhakti Sundar Govinda Mahārāj penned the preceding Praṇati-daśakam as an offering to his Gurudev. All over the world it is sung with devotion by the devotees of Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj. Śrīmad Bhakti Sundar Govinda Mahārāj is a distinguished and talented Sanskrit scholar and illustrious preacher of the precepts of Śrī Chaitanyadev, qualities that were prominent in his glorious Gurudev Om Viṣṇupād Aṣṭottara-śata-śrī Śrīmad Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj."},{"class":"b55","text":" Humbly,<br />Tridaṇḍi Swāmī B.A. Sāgar<br />Editor"}]}]}')}}]);
