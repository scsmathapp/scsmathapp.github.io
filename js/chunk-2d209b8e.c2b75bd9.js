It was enriched so much with Kṛṣṇa-bhakti. He grew up there with the children of the village, and His Pastimes were all very miraculous. All the children of Ekachakrā would play with Nityānanda Prabhu, but He would only play Kṛṣṇa-līlā.

The sannyāsī fainted to see Nityānanda Prabhu and finally asked His father, Hāḍāi Paṇḍit, “I am going to many pilgrimage places, and it is my prayer that you give this boy to me as an associate servitor.” Hearing this was like a thunderbolt to Hāḍāi Paṇḍit. Hāḍāi Paṇḍit was beside himself to hear this, and he fainted. Nityānanda Prabhu was the very joy of his life. At that time religion was very strong within the mind of everyone. It was the custom that if any sannyāsī, especially any Vaiṣṇava sannyāsī, wants anything, one’s son or even one’s life, the people give it to him. They may give everything to a sannyāsī. Nityānanda Prabhu was more than life to Hāḍāi Paṇḍit, but that was the custom. Hāḍāi Paṇḍit felt he could never leave his only son Nityānanda, but he also felt he could not say, “No, I cannot leave Nityānanda.” So finally he considered, “The sannyāsī has prayed, and we must fulfil his desire.” He could not deny the sannyāsī’s demand, and finally he gave Nityānanda Prabhu to that sannyāsī."},{"class":"b44","text":" After giving away Nityānanda, Hāḍāi Paṇḍit was like a crazy man (<span class=\\"e3\\">loke bale, “Hāḍo Ojhā haila pāgala”</span> (Cb: Madhya, 3.98).).

Nityānanda Prabhu was perhaps one year senior in age to Mahāprabhu, and before joining in Mahāprabhu’s Pastimes, Nityānanda Prabhu did not reveal much of His actual nature. But He was always thinking Himself to be Balarām, and His activities were like that. He was not hiding that. Finally He went to Vṛndāvan, where He searched, “Where is Kṛṣṇa? Where is Kṛṣṇa?” He asked the Vraja-vāsīs where He could find Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa Himself in the form of a human came to Him and said, “I am not here. I have now appeared in a household in Nabadwīp.” Then, clearly the feeling manifested within the heart of Nityānanda Prabhu: “Now My time has come to join Chaitanyadev—Nimāi Paṇḍit—in Nabadwīp Dhām.” He knew that Nimaī Paṇḍit was really Kṛṣṇa Himself."},{"class":"b70","text":" The Avadhūt"},{"class":"b50","text":" When Śrīpād Nityānanda Prabhu first came to Nabadwīp Dhām, no one could understand who He was or where He had come from.
