His first contact with Sri Gaudiya Math was in 1923, and he fully commited himself to this Mission of his Guru, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupad, in 1926. In 1930 his Guru gave him sannyasa, giving him his transcendental name, Bhakti Rakshak [Guardian of Devotion].

Especially active in the field of publishing transcendental literature, his erudition was profoundly commanding and elaborate.

His style of presentation was chiefly analytic, simple, and appealing. He taught that the apparently sophisticated philosophies and doctrines which deviate one to materialism, salvation, voidism, etc. [karma, jnana, sunya-vada, etc.] must be abandoned by the true aspirants of devotion; yet, he acknowledged that from the universal standpoint such \"charming\" distractions served to segregate the insincere from the sincere.
