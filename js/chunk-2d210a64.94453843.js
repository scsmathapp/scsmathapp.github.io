We are anxious to gather whatever information is contained in it and with such acquirement our curiosity stops. This mode of study prevails amongst a large number of readers, who are great men in their own estimation, as well as in the estimation of those who are of their own stamp. In fact, most readers are mere repositories of facts and statements made by other people. But this is not study. The student is to read the facts with a view to create, and not with the object of fruitless retention. Students, like satellites, should reflect whatever light they receive from authors, and not imprison the facts and thoughts just as the magistrates imprison the convicts in the jail!"},{"class":"b44","text":" Thought is progressive. The author’s thought must have progress in the reader, in the shape of correction or development. He is the best critic who can show the further development of an old thought; but a mere denouncer is the enemy of progress and consequently of nature. “Begin anew,” says the critic, “because the old masonry does not answer at present. Let the old author be buried because his time is gone.” These are shallow expressions. Progress is certainly the law of nature and there must be corrections and developments with the passage of time, as progress means going further or rising higher."},{"class":"b44","text":" If we follow our foolish critic, we are to go back to our former terminus and make a new race, and when we have run half the race another critic of his stamp will cry out: “Begin anew, because the wrong road has been taken!” In this way our stupid critics will never allow us to go over the whole road and see what is in the other terminus. Thus the shallow critic and the fruitless reader are the two great enemies of progress. We must shun them."},{"class":"b44","text":" The true critic, on the other hand, advises us to preserve what we have already obtained, and adjust our race from that point where we have arrived in the heat of our progress. He will never advise us to go back to the point whence we started, as he fully knows that in that case there will be a fruitless loss of our valuable time and labor. He will direct the adjustment of the angle of the race at the point where we are. This is also the characteristic of the useful student. He will read an old author and will find out his exact position in the progress of thought. He will never propose to burn a book on the ground that it contains thoughts that are useless. No thought is useless. Thoughts are means by which we attain our objects. The reader who denounces a bad thought does not know that even a bad road is capable of improvement and conversion into a good one. One thought is a road leading to another. Thus the reader will find that the thought which is the object today will be the means of a further object tomorrow. Thoughts will necessarily continue to be an endless series of means and objects in the progress of humanity."},{"class":"b44","text":" The great reformers will always assert that they have come not to destroy the old law, but to fulfill it. Vālmīki, Vyāsa, Plato, Jesus, Mohammed, Confucius and Chaitanya Mahāprabhu assert this fact, either expressly or by their conduct."},{"class":"b44","text":" Subjects of philosophy and theology are like the peaks of towering and inaccessible mountains inviting attention and investigation. Thinkers and men of deep speculation take their observations through the instruments of reason and consciousness, but they take different points when they carry on their work."},{"class":"b44","text":" These points are positions chalked out by the circumstances of their social and philosophical life, different as they are in the different parts of the world."},{"class":"b44","text":" Plato looked at the peak of the spiritual question from the West and Vyāsa made the observation from the East. Confucius did it from further East and Schlegel, Spinoza, Kant and Goethe from further West. Their observations were made at different times by different means, but the conclusion is all the same, in as much as the object of observation was one and the same. They all hunted after the Great Spirit, the unconditioned Soul of the Universe. They could not but get an insight into it. Their words and expressions were different, but their import is the same. They tried to find the absolute religion and their labors were crowned with success, for God gives all that He has to His children, if they want to have it. It requires a candid, generous, pious and holy heart to feel the beauties of their conclusions."},{"class":"b44","text":" The true critic is a generous judge, devoid of prejudices and party spirit. Party spirit, that great enemy of truth, will always baffle the attempt of the inquirer and will make him believe that Absolute Truth is nowhere except in his old religious book. What better example could be adduced than the fact that the philosopher of Benares will find no truth in the universal brotherhood of men and the common fatherhood of God? The philosopher, thinking in his own way of thought, can never, see the beauty of the"},{"class":"b44","text":" Christian faith. The way in which Christ thought of his own Father was love absolute, and so long as the philosopher will not adopt that way of thinking, he will ever remain deprived of the absolute faith preached by the Western Saviour. In a similar manner, the Christian needs adopt the way of thought, which the Vedāntist pursued before he can love the conclusions of the philosopher. The critic should, therefore, have a comprehensive, good, generous, candid, impartial and sympathetic soul."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Bhāgavata, the revealed scripture of the Vaishnavas, does not allow its followers to ask anything from God except eternal love towards Him. The kingdom of the world, the beauties of the local heavens, and sovereignty over the material world are never the subject of Vaishnava prayer. The Vaishnava meekly and humbly prays, “Father, Master, God, Friend and Husband of my soul, hallowed be Thy name! I do not approach You for anything which You have already given me. I have sinned against You and I now repent and solicit Your pardon. Let Thy holiness touch my soul and make me free from grossness. Let my spirit be devoted meekly to Your Holy service in absolute love towards Thee."},{"class":"b44","text":" “I have called You my God, and let my soul be wrapped up in admiration at Your greatness. I have addressed You as my Master, and let my soul be strongly devoted to Your service. I have called You my friend, and let my soul be in reverential love towards You, and not in dread or fear. I have called You my husband, and let my spiritual nature be in eternal union with You, forever loving and never dreading or feeling disgust. Father! Let me have strength enough to go up to You as the Consort of my soul, so that we may be one in eternal Love! Peace to the world!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The spirit of this text goes far to honor all great reformers and teachers who lived and will live in other countries. The Vaishnava is ready to honor all great men without distinction of caste, because they are filled with the energy of God. See how universal is the Vaishnava religion! It is not intended for a certain class of Hindus alone, but it is a gift to man at large, in whatever country he is born and in whatever society he is bred."},{"class":"b51","text":" In short, Vaishnavism is the Absolute Love binding together all men in the Infinite, Unconditioned and Absolute God. May peace reign forever in the whole universe, in the continual development of its purity, by the exertion of the future heroes who will be blessed, according to the promise of the Bhāgavata, with powers from the Almighty Father, the Creator, Preserver and Annihilator of all things in Heaven and Earth."},{"class":"b55","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">— From a lecture delivered by Srila Bhaktivinod Thakur in 1869 at Dinajpur, West Bengal</span>"}]},{"title":"The Blind Men &amp; the Elephant","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b47","text":" The Blind Men & the Elephant"},{"class":"b42","text":" It was six men of Indostan<br />To learning much inclined<br />Who went to see the elephant<br />(Though all of them were blind)<br />That each by observation<br />Might satisfy his mind."},{"class":"b42","text":" The First approached the Elephant<br />And happening to fall<br />Against his broad and sturdy side<br />At once began to bawl:<br />“God bless me! but the Elephant<br />is very like a wall!”"},{"class":"b42","text":" The Second, feeling of the tusk,<br />Cried, “Ho, what have we here<br />So very round and smooth and sharp?<br />To me ‘tis mighty clear<br />This wonder of an Elephant<br />Is very like a spear!”"},{"class":"b42","text":" The Third approached the animal,<br />And happening to take<br />The squirming trunk within his hands<br />Thus boldly up and spake:<br />“I see,” quoth he, “The Elephant<br />is very like a snake!”"},{"class":"b42","text":" The Fourth reached out an eager hand<br />And felt about the knee<br />“What most this wondrous beast is like<br />Is mighty plain!” quoth he:<br />“‘Tis clear enough the Elephant is very like a tree!”"},{"class":"b42","text":" The Fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,<br />Said: “E’en the blindest man<br />Can tell what this resembles most:<br />Deny the fact who can,<br />This marvel of an elephant<br />Is very like a fan!”"},{"class":"b42","text":" The Sixth no sooner had begun<br />About the beast to grope<br />Than seizing of the swinging tail<br />That fell within his scope,<br />“I see,” quoth he, “the Elephant<br />Is very like a rope!”"},{"class":"b42","text":" And so these men of Indostan<br />Disputed loud and long,<br />Each in his own opinion<br />Exceeding stiff and strong,<br />Though each was partly in the right<br />And all were in the wrong!"},{"class":"b42","text":" So oft in theologic wars<br />The disputants, I ween,<br />Rail on in utter ignorance<br />Of what the others mean,<br />And prate about an Elephant<br />Not one of them has seen!"},{"class":"b92","text":" John G.

If you want to be a master, then you will have to come down into the lower zone, where you can be a master."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is neither exaggeration nor imagination, it is something scientific.

This scientific truth should be understood."},{"class":"b44","text":" By robbing things someone can find superficial satisfaction, but underground there is some suspicion that the result won’t be very good, “the reaction will come to attack me.” To exploit by stealing provides some sort of enjoyment, but the big donors, patrons, give some charity and thereby also enjoy happiness. There is a difference in quality between these two sorts of happiness. We are to distinguish between them."},{"class":"b44","text":" In different planes there are different conceptions of happiness, and a comparison is to be drawn between the qualitative differences in the pleasure derived.

It is the land of spontaneous service; you will do according to your inner sagacity, and that will be accepted. The hearty thing, the sincere flow of service. No thrust from outside, no regulation. “You must do this, you must not do that.” That sort of law will be withdrawn from you, when you reach the plane of spontaneous service."},{"class":"b44","text":" After passing for some time through the process of regulated devotional service you will feel: “This higher plane is my own land.

Any lower propensity will vanish, and in the sealed portion of your heart, that can connect with the higher divinity, the seal will be broken. The inner wealth is there, within, but it is sealed.

He explains that the greatness of the Holy Name may not be found in the ordinary scriptures, but if you study all of them as a whole, you will find the very spirit of the Holy Name. Ordinary people may not find this in their study, but there are those who can collect the real substance, the real purpose from those vast writings, and detect the greatness of the Holy Name as the whole purpose of all the main Vedic scriptures."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Vedas are giving hints about the Holy Name of Krishna. The Vedas naturally tell us that we can approach the supreme reality only through sound. Otherwise they would be suicidal. If they do not say that by sound only we will attain the truth, then what is the necessity of the Vedas, which are only embodied sounds? So, if we can trace their real characteristic, we shall find that the principal Vedas say that by the cultivation of sound we can attain the Lord. Absolute sound alone can deliver reality."},{"class":"b44","text":" So Rūpa Goswāmī says that a superficial study of the Vedas will only frustrate us. But if we search with a positive mind, by the grace of the saints, the spiritual masters and the great souls, we will find that the principal sound forms of the revealed truth are leading us towards the conception that the whole object of all the Vedic sounds is that central sound: the Holy Name of Krishna."},{"class":"b44","text":" There are so many sections of the Vedas that have come to distribute the tidings of the absolute realm, but there must be a centre. So, the principal sounds are all emitting light, like a torch, to show us that they have a central sound which represents the supreme whole, and that sound is ‘Krishna’. So many liberated souls are all around, offering their respects to the Name of Krishna, that central sound from which all Vedic mantras have come to give us some idea of the sound aspect of the absolute centre. This is Śrī Rūpa’s argument."},{"class":"b44","text":" The branches of the Vedas are all sounds, and so many sounds must come from a central position. They cannot but direct one who has a proper eye towards that fountainhead of sound, saying, “Go! Run towards that direction! In our source you will find everything. We are all partially representing so many things, but we have a centre, we have a fountainhead. Go in that direction and you will find the sound that can sufficiently satisfy you, and you may also be introduced to other aspects of that sound.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The Holy Name of Krishna is most important; it is no less than Krishna Himself. It fully represents the whole. Śrī Rūpa says, “O Holy Name, I take refuge under Your lotus feet. You are the grand, central sound who has given cohesion to all the sounds in the revealed scriptures.” And Śrī Sanātan, who is the spiritual master of Śrī Rūpa, says: “Let ecstasy in the service of the Divine Name be victorious.

We will be unable to attempt them: we will take to the Name only. Then, when the Name allows us to perform other services again, we will be able to do them. The Name has such power, such a high degree of potency, that it will stop all other branches of service and charm you."},{"class":"b44","text":" When the Holy Name of Krishna descends and captures the tongue and the lips, it controls them so strongly that it engages them in chanting the Holy Name as if the lips and tongue have gone mad.

No adverse circumstance can produce any obstacle to this."},{"class":"b44","text":" The only condition is that to have the real thing we must have a proper connection. It must be the Name of Krishna and not an imitation. So, it is said that the physical sound may appear, an imitation, but it is not effective, because that is not Krishna."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our attainment of the goal is not assured simply by increasing the number of times we repeat the Name; only by increasing the quality will we reach success. There are so many sayings in the Scriptures to encourage our realization of the Holy Name in different ways, but Śrī Rūpa has given us a central thought. He quotes the Padma Purāṇa: “Our senses, physical or mental, are ineligible to come in touch with the transcendental.” The Name is non-material, without mundane limitation. It belongs to another plane."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, nothing about Krishna—His name, form, qualities or pastimes—can be touched by our physical or mental senses, but when we have a serving attitude He comes down to us of His own accord. Only then can our tongue really pronounce the Name of Krishna, otherwise only the physical sound of the letters of the Name can be produced."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our tongue, our hands, physical sound, all these mundane things cannot come in touch with Krishna.

Only when the electrical current is there will the bulb be illuminated. So, the Name may appear on the tongue and in the ear, in the mind or in writing, but we must have the connection from the transcendental realm to this mundane world, and that connection is devotional service, a functional serving attitude. That alone can connect the physical realm with the unlimited spiritual world."},{"class":"b44","text":" Krishna will appear of His own accord. He will descend upon your tongue and then your tongue will be able to chant the Name of Krishna. A gun that has no bullet, but only a blank, may make some sound, but no bullet is actually fired. Similarly, chanting the Name of Krishna without an attitude of service produces sound, but that is only tongue deep. It is like firing a gun with blanks instead of bullets."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our chanting of the Holy Name of Krishna must be surcharged with a serving temperament, the tendency to satisfy Krishna. Otherwise the sound we produce is bogus. It is only an imitation, or a permutation. The Holy Name cannot be experienced by our senses. It is supramental and transcendental. An ordinary sound of this mundane world cannot be the Name of Krishna. Our ear cannot even hear the Name if that mediator, the serving attitude, is not there. The earnestness to satisfy Krishna’s will must mediate between Krishna and the ear, through the mind. Then only will Krishna’s Name enter our ear and reveal to us His form, qualities and pastimes."},{"class":"b52","text":" The Holy Name is not physical, it is transcendental, supra-mundane. Only through our service attitude will it come down to this mundane world. Only through service can we directly come in contact with Krishna.

If it is a living and real Name, the voice will be choked up, there will be shivering in the body, and the legs will be unable to stand.

Sometimes changes of colour will be found in the body, and we will be unable to find any trace of mind or consciousness. We may fall in a swoon. The whole body and mind will appear as if it is being attacked: shivering and influenced in different ways.

Whatever He likes to do, He will do. Since it is not possible for me to give any resistance, I must surrender. Let me also cooperate with whatever He is pleased to do. Otherwise, what can I do? I am helpless.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “Sometimes I find that the sweetness of the Name is condensed like a blossoming flower, and very wonderful streams of sweet current are flowing from it.

I find that I am in the midst of His peculiar, very sweet and loving paraphernalia. And He says, ‘You see! I have so many wonderful things. This is your home. I am not merely imagination, but concrete reality. You will find here that the environment is very favorable and sweet. You are to live here.”"},{"class":"b52","text":" “I see that there He is dealing in different ways with His associates in different rasas, and I find that I have another body that has emerged from my previous one, and that has a permanent place here in His service.

This is proper and that was a sham, that life has vanished. Then I find that chanting the Holy Name has given me new encouragement, a new prospect, and new hope.” Whatever we want, whatever is our internal demand, it is supplied by the Holy Name. If we take the Holy Name, all our internal hankering will be fulfilled. It is eternal, it is the purest of the pure, and it is full of ecstasy."}]}]}')}}]);
