We are anxious to gather whatever information is contained in it, and with such acquirement our curiosity stops. This mode of study prevails amongst a great number of readers who are great men in their own estimation as well as in the estimation of those who are of their own stamp. In fact, most readers are mere repositories of facts and statements made by other people. But this is not study. The student is to read the facts with a view to create, and not with the object of fruitless retention. Students, like satellites, should reflect whatever light they receive from authors, and not imprison the facts and thoughts just as the magistrates imprison the convicts in the jail!"},{"class":"b44","text":" Thought is progressive. The author’s thought must have progress in the reader in the shape of correction or development. He is the best critic who can show the further development of an old thought; but a mere denouncer is the enemy of progress, and consequently of nature. Progress certainly is the law of nature, and there must be corrections and developments with the progress of time. But progress means going further or rising higher. The shallow critic and the fruitless reader are the two great enemies of progress. We must shun them."},{"class":"b44","text":" The true critic, on the other hand, advises us to preserve what we have already obtained and to adjust our race from that point where we have arrived in the heat of our progress. He will never advise us to go back to the point whence we started, as he fully knows that in that case there will be a fruitless loss of our valuable time and labour. He will direct the adjustment of the angle of our race at the point where we are."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is also the characteristic of the useful student. He will read an old author and will find out his exact position in the progress of thought. He will never propose to burn a book on the ground that it contains thoughts which are useless. No thought is useless. Thoughts are means by which we attain our objects. The reader who denounces a bad thought does not know that a bad road is even capable of improvement and conversion into a good one. One thought is a road leading to another. Thus, the reader will find that one thought, which is the object today, will be the means of a further object tomorrow. Thoughts will necessarily continue to be an endless series of means and objects in the progress of humanity. The great reformers will always assert that they have come out not to destroy the old law, but to fulfil it. Vālmīki, Vyās, Plato, Jesus, Mohammed, Confucius, and Chaitanya Mahāprabhu assert the fact either expressly or by their conduct."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our critic, however, may nobly tell us that a reformer like Vyās, unless purely explained, may lead thousands of men into great trouble in time to come. But dear critic! Study the history of ages and countries! Where have you found the philosopher and reformer fully understood by the people? The popular religion is fear of God, and not the pure spiritual love which Plato, Vyās, Jesus, and Chaitanya taught to their respective peoples! Whether you give the absolute religion in figures or simple expressions or teach them by means of books or oral speeches, the ignorant and the thoughtless must degrade it."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is indeed very easy to tell, and swift to hear, that Absolute Truth has such an affinity with the human soul that it comes through as if intuitively, and that no exertion is necessary to teach the precepts of true religion, but this is a deceptive idea. It may be true of ethics and of the alphabet of religion but not of the highest form of faith, which requires an exalted soul to understand. All higher truths, though intuitive, require previous education in the simpler ones. That religion is the purest which gives us the purest idea of God. How then is it possible that the ignorant will ever obtain the absolute religion as long as they are ignorant?"},{"class":"b44","text":" So we are not to scandalise the Saviour of Jerusalem or the Saviour of Nadia for these subsequent evils. Luthers, instead of critics, are what we want for the correction of those evils by the true interpretation of the original precepts."},{"class":"b44","text":" God gives us truth as He gave it to Vyās when we earnestly seek for it. Truth is eternal and inexhaustible. The soul receives a revelation when it is anxious for it. The souls of the great thinkers of the bygone ages, who now live spiritually, often approach our enquiring spirit and assist it in its development. Thus, Vyās was assisted by Nārad and Brahmā. Our śāstras, or in other words, books of thought, do not contain all that we could get from the infinite Father. No book is without its errors. God’s revelation is Absolute Truth, but it is scarcely received and preserved in its natural purity. We have been advised in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> (11.14.3) to believe that truth when revealed is absolute, but it gets the tincture of the nature of the receiver in course of time and is converted into error by continual exchange of hands from age to age. New revelations, therefore, are continually necessary in order to keep truth in its original purity. We are thus warned to be careful in our studies of old authors, however wise they are reputed to be. Here, we have full liberty to reject the wrong idea which is not sanctioned by the peace of conscience."},{"class":"b44","text":" Vyās was not satisfied with what he collected in the Vedas, arranged in the Purāṇas, and composed in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Mahābhārata</span>. The peace of his conscience did not sanction his labours. It told him from inside, “No, Vyās! You can’t rest contented with the erroneous picture of truth which was necessarily presented to you by the sages of bygone days! You must yourself knock at the door of the inexhaustible store of truth from which the former sages drew their wealth. Go! Go up to the fountainhead of truth, where no pilgrim meets with disappointment of any kind.” Vyās did it and obtained what he wanted. We have all been advised to do so."},{"class":"b44","text":" Liberty then, is the principle which we must consider as the most valuable gift of God. We must not allow ourselves to be led by those who lived and thought before us. We must think for ourselves and try to get further truths, which are still undiscovered. In the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> (11.21.23), we have been advised to take the spirit of the śāstras, and not the words. The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> is therefore a religion of liberty, unmixed truth, and absolute love."},{"class":"b44","text":" The other characteristic is progress. Liberty certainly is the father of all progress. Holy liberty is the cause of progress upwards and upwards in eternity and endless activity of love. Liberty misused causes degradation, and the Vaiṣṇava must always carefully use this high and beautiful gift of God."},{"class":"b44","text":" The spirit of this text goes far to honour all great reformers and teachers who lived and will live in other countries. The Vaiṣṇava is ready to honour all men without distinction of caste because they are filled with the energy of God. See how universal is the religion of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>. It is not intended for a certain class of Hindus alone, but it is a gift to man at large, in whatever country he is born and in whatever society he is bred. In short, Vaiṣṇavism is the absolute love binding all men together into the infinite unconditioned and absolute God. May peace reign forever in the whole universe in the continual development of its purity by the exertion of the future heroes, who will be blessed according to the promise of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> with powers from the almighty Father, the creator, preserver, and the annihilator of all things in heaven and earth."},{"class":"b45","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">—From an English lecture delivered in 1869, <br />at Dinajpur, West Bengal.</span>"}]},{"title":"Preface","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b47","text":" Preface"},{"class":"b37","text":" by"},{"class":"b66","text":" Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Prabhupād"},{"class":"b42","text":" Founder-Āchārya <br />of the <br />International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness"},{"class":"b43","text":" We are very fortunate to hear His Divine Grace Om Viṣṇupād Paramahaṁsa Parivrājakāchārya Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Mahārāj.

In the soul, there are many conceptions, and one conception is that of stone. It is all in the plane of consciousness. But that stone can produce soul, or consciousness, is difficult, ridiculous, inconceivable, and unreasonable. Rather, it is the opposite, something like the Berkeley theory that the world is in the mind and not that the mind is in the world.

Ether can produce fire and earth, but the earth cannot produce ether. The subtle is more efficient than the gross. The gross is of secondary importance. The soul, ātmā, is of principle importance. The origin of everything must be conscious; the starting point must begin with the interested party. The soul is endowed with interest, but a stone has no interest, plan, or project—nothing of the kind. But there is a plan and a purpose pervading everything, and that is the important thing. According to that consideration, the characteristic of the Absolute, the original substance, should be calculated. An object of limited attributes and capacity cannot be the ultimate cause. Only a thing of unlimited quality and capacity should be taken as the cause of the whole. That is a more reasonable idea. Science should realise this.

I am not the master of anything.” That sort of knowledge we should imbibe, and that will be helpful to our real spiritual progress. This is reality. We have to realise that fact. We want the truth, and we want to free ourselves from false notions. So, proper dīkṣā, spiritual initiation, imparts the divine knowledge that nothing belongs to us; not only that, but everything belongs to God, including ourselves.

We will no longer feel encouragement to meet with the duties that are relating to this world of enjoyment. We will be indifferent."},{"class":"b69","text":" We know that the connection with the present enjoying mood brings a painful reaction. We can realise that, but we cannot leave it behind. We cannot cut off the connection completely in the stage of sādhana, spiritual practice. Still, we have no other alternative. Our affinity for the positive truth should be increased more and more, and gradually our affinity for our paraphernalia and obligations will all disappear. Although repeatedly we may not be successful, still we will be unable to give up the idea.

We will find that those unwanted things were like mushrooms; they came out from our mental soil, and now they have all gone and died. They have all gone away, and Kṛṣṇa alone is in the heart. At that time, the heart is only full of Kṛṣṇa, full of the Kṛṣṇa conception."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur once instructed a disciple at the time of initiation into the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra that Kṛṣṇa should be allowed to land in our hearts, just as an army is landed by the navy. An army is carried by a ship, and when they have landed, the fight begins, and they capture the country, just as Julius Caesar said, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Veni vidi vici</span>: I came, I saw, I conquered.” So, we have to allow Kṛṣṇa to land in our hearts.

They are all giving us their assurances from time immemorial, saying, “I shall give you this, I shall give you that”, but the Kṛṣṇa conception will enter and say, “My claim is this: the whole thing is Mine, and you are all trespassers.” The fight will begin. The unwanted things are sure to withdraw, and Kṛṣṇa consciousness will capture the whole heart. This is the process. Kṛṣṇa consciousness has only to land within our hearts. Somehow or other, from a pure devotee, a bit of real Kṛṣṇa consciousness should enter through our ears into our hearts, and Kṛṣṇa will supply whatever is required.

Kṛṣṇa is a thief, and stealthily He will enter one day."},{"class":"b44","text":" A devotee may become hopeless, thinking, “The enemy is within my own house; my own kinsmen are my enemies. I am hopeless.” We may become disappointed, but Kṛṣṇa consciousness will not leave us in any way. Kṛṣṇa will persevere, and in due course of time, He will conquer. And other things, no matter how closely related they may be in private and well-protected rooms in our hearts, will have to go. They must take leave from every corner of our hearts. Kṛṣṇa will conquer. Kṛṣṇa will capture the whole thing. The unwanted lusty desires of our heart are foreign things. They are only mushrooms. Like mushrooms, they come out; they have no permanent stability or root. They are not rooted to the soil.

Those persons who worship demigods for temporary gain are not considered saints. They may be neglected, for they are not devotees. Saint means Vaiṣṇava, or devotee. All others, such as the worshippers of demigods, are not considered saints. We avoid them. A saint is one who has no ambition in his life but to have a connection of loving service with the Supreme Lord. Only those who are agents of eternal truth, absolute good, are to be considered saintly. We should not abuse such saintly persons."},{"class":"b70","text":" Demigod worship"},{"class":"b71","text":" The second offence concerns how we should treat the demigods, including Śiva, Śakti, the sun-god, and others. They are not to be considered equal to or greater than Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa. They are under Him, and they are all inferior to Him. They are given engagements by the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, and they have to discharge their duties according to His order. They are never equal or superior to Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b70","text":" Guru: good as God"},{"class":"b43","text":" The third offence is to consider the Guru a human being. Although so many human symptoms may be found in him, still, according to our sincerity to meet Godhead, the Lord descends and represents Himself in the Guru to satisfy our hunger for the truth. We must see him as the agent of the Lord. It has been advised to us in a general way not to think of the Guru as a mortal being because if our attempt to attain the Absolute is sincere, then He will also come to us to deliver us. God is omniscient, so through a particular agent who acts as His representative, He comes here to accept us and take us up to the higher plane. We are ordered by the advice of the scriptures to see the Guru as the representative of the Absolute because none can give us Kṛṣṇa but He Himself."},{"class":"b44","text":" God’s presence should be perceived in our Gurudev. We should see that God has come to give Himself to us. Generally, we find mortal signs in the body of the spiritual master, but we must transcend that. The Ganges water may be filthy in external appearance, but still the dirty Ganges water can purify us by its touch. To our material senses, the Deity seems to be wood, stone, or earth, but that is our polluted vision. Kṛṣṇa is there, and sometimes He is seen to walk and to talk with devotees of a higher order. We must not think that He is made of material stuff. When we go and stand before the Deity, we should not think that we can see Him, but that He is seeing us. He is in the subjective plane; I am His object."},{"class":"b51","text":" He is mercifully seeing us to purify us. In this way, our vision must be adjusted. Kṛṣṇa was killed by a hunter; the atheists will interpret that it was an ordinary incident, but it is not so. Sītā was stolen by Rāvaṇa. This is all external, all illusory. The real truth is above, in the transcendental realm. So, we are requested by the expert transcendentalists and by the śāstra to see that our Gurudev is above these mortal signs.

We must not abuse those scriptures that instruct us about God and His devotees and teach us the eternal good."},{"class":"b70","text":" Holy Name: God in sound"},{"class":"b43","text":" The fifth offence is to interpret the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa with the help of the dictionary and grammar, to find diverse meanings in the words of the Name. The sound is transcendental. The dictionary, grammar, and any other books of mundane knowledge cannot limit or qualify the Holy Name. Above the material sound of the Name is the transcendental sound within (Śabda-brahma). The Name itself is the Supreme Person incarnate by His own free will. He is inseparable from His Name and fully present in His sound form."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Vaikuṇṭha-śabda, transcendental sound, is different from the mundane sound that can be produced by the tongue and lips. In homeopathic medicine, all the globules are apparently the same, but the potency within is all-important. It is something like that. The ordinary sound of the Name, and the sound vibrated by a pure devotee come from different planes. The difference is in the potency within. The Holy Name descends from the spiritual world and comes to express itself by dancing on the tongue. The transcendental sound of the Holy Name is inseparably connected with the person whom it represents."},{"class":"b69","text":" The sixth offence is to consider the glories of the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa to be a concoction."},{"class":"b70","text":" To sin and chant is suicidal"},{"class":"b71","text":" The seventh offence is to sin on the strength of the Holy Name. The scriptures declare that one Name is sufficient to clear all the sins one can commit, so if we go on indulging, committing many sins with the idea that we will chant one Name to cleanse the sin, it will be an offence to the Name and not the Name proper. We cannot try to utilise Him for our service; He is above all this māyā. The real Name will not appear there. We must not think, “I can do anything and everything, and the Name will purify me.” It is written in the scriptures that if you go on with this spirit, it will be suicidal."},{"class":"b70","text":" Hare Kṛṣṇa: the supreme purification"},{"class":"b71","text":" The eighth offence is to think that chanting the Holy Name is another pious activity like penance, pilgrimage, giving in charity, service to the country, and so on. If we think lightly of the Holy Name in this way, then we commit an offence because the Holy Name is absolute and these other processes have only a partial, relative position. Other processes are partial—they award some success in this mundane world—but the Name can give the Lord Himself. So, no other process of purification can hold the same position as chanting the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa. It is supreme, and none can come close to it."},{"class":"b70","text":" Forbidden for the faithless"},{"class":"b71","text":" The ninth offence is to give the Name to those who do not deserve it, who have no faith in chanting the Name. If you press them to chant the Holy Name, a bad reaction will come to you. Also, without getting any inspiration, we should not make disciples and give Hari-nām initiation. We will commit offence against the Name if we make a business or trade with Name-giving. If we give the Name to anyone and everyone, out of greed for becoming a guru, then it will be an offence. Without sanction from above, if one runs to become a guru to get name and fame with some mundane purpose, then it is a great offence."},{"class":"b70","text":" Back to Godhead"},{"class":"b43","text":" The tenth offence is to be too much addicted to a particular thing, or to have too much affinity towards the body and bodily wealth. When a boat is anchored, rowing will simply move the boat around the anchor. The anchor must be taken up, and then the boat can move forward. So, we must not anchor ourselves down with a particular thing. We must be open. The Name will create some transformation within the mental system, and we must be open and unprejudiced enough to go where the Name will send us. If we carefully try to avoid that transformation and stick to our present life, that is an offence against the Name: to invite Him, and then ignore Him."},{"class":"b44","text":" We must not accept the Name as a foreign thing; He is our friend. We should be quite at home with Him. We are going to attain a very soothing and friendly connection by the realisation of the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa, which is all-good, all-beautiful, and all-charming. By chanting the Holy Name, we will attain our most desirable end of life and go back to God, back to home, and not to any foreign country."},{"class":"b44","text":" We must take the Name in a friendly, affectionate way. The Name is the only object of our love. He is our friend, and not any anti-party. So, the Name will take us home—not to any foreign land. That is our sweet home, and He is our sweet guardian.

The first is <span class=\\"e3\\">sānketya</span>: chanting indirectly, to indicate something else, as in the case of Ajāmil."},{"class":"b44","text":" Ajāmil was a brāhmaṇ’s son.

It is a faint connection with the Holy Name. It was neither out of faith, nor by the order of his guru, that he chanted the Name of Nārāyaṇ. It was not that he purposely went to take the Name, but by accident it flashed in his mind.

We want to live the life of those who want not to extract, but to give. We want a civilised life in the domain of higher civilisation, where everyone is a giving unit, an emanating unit, and not an absorbing unit. There, everyone is especially God-centred and harmonious. They are all of the nature of divinity. And divinity means dedication towards the centre of all harmony, the absolute good. So with that spirit, we are to chant the Holy Name, and every action should be done with devotion for Kṛṣṇa.

I was in charge of the Delhi temple at the time and was intimate with him, so I wrote to Prabhupād: “If you permit, I would like to engage my godbrother in some preaching work here in the Delhi temple.” The letter that Prabhupād wrote is still here. He wrote me in his letter, “If you can bring him there and make him help you in the work of preaching, then you will be doing the service of a real friend to him.

He told me, “Sometimes I preach about Madhva Āchārya and the bhakti cult, but I have no time for sādhana; regulated spiritual practices such as japa, gāyatrī-mantra, scriptural study, and so on. I supported him. Our Guru Mahārāj said that Hari-kathā, preaching about Kṛṣṇa, is no less important than sādhana. Rather, it is a more living thing. Preaching is more vital. When we are preaching, automatically we must have the maximum concentration. On the other hand, while chanting on our japa beads, we may be absent-minded. When we are speaking about Kṛṣṇa to another person, we must be all-attentive. Otherwise, we cannot speak accurately. All our attention will automatically be concentrated when we talk about Kṛṣṇa. And in writing about Kṛṣṇa, accuracy is even more necessary than in speaking about Kṛṣṇa. So, writing is also kīrtan. The cultivation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness may even be more intense when we are engaged in writing about Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b70","text":" Gauḍīya Maṭh: war against māyā"},{"class":"b43","text":" So, the preaching mission of Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur, the Gauḍīya Maṭh, has declared totalitarian war against māyā, illusion, and even all other existing conceptions of religion. And our authority is <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> and Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. Divine love is the supreme most goal of every soul. Beauty and love is the summum bonum, our highest attainment; that is the ultimate controlling principle, and not power. And beauty and love are found at their highest position in Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvan. The ultimate conception of the Absolute Truth is that of reality the beautiful and divine love. At the same time, the difference between lust and love should be clearly realised. That should not be misconceived. The acme of dedication is demonstrated in the love of the inhabitants of Vraja."},{"class":"b69","text":" So, preaching (saṅkīrtan), and not counting beads (japa), is the real service of Kṛṣṇa. But because we have taken a vow, and it is ordered by Mahāprabhu and our Gurudev, we must chant the Holy Name while counting beads; it is our duty. Our Guru Mahārāj told us, “The japa beads must not fast.” So, if we engage ourselves in preaching work, there should be no doubt that we are really obeying the order of Mahāprabhu. Although He has advised us to chant one hundred thousand Names, or sixty-four rounds daily, that is a provincial saying. What is really all-important is the spirit of service. We are not told that the gopīs always count the Name on tulasī beads, yet they possess the highest position in the service of Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvan."},{"class":"b70","text":" Vṛndāvan express train"},{"class":"b50","text":" So, Kṛṣṇa-nām will help us greatly to go towards Vṛndāvan. Its importance is there. Like an express train, the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa carries us to the goal without stopping at any other station. If we are chanting the Name without any formal petition, without asking, “Give me this, give me that”, it acts like a special train that will go to Vṛndāvan non-stop. There, the impurities of karma and jñān are absent. The devotees of Vṛndāvan simply think, “I want Kṛṣṇa. I do not know what is good or bad. I simply want Kṛṣṇa.”"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Student:</span> How many rounds did your Guru Mahārāj ask his initiated disciples to chant each day?

Formally, one had to do some counting, but there was no rigid limitation. What he wanted from us was intense engagement in the service of the Lord under the guidance of a Vaiṣṇava because the all-important point is service. Our attainment of the goal is not insured simply by increasing the number of times we repeat the Name; only by increasing the quality will we reach success."},{"class":"b69","text":" There are so many sayings in the scriptures to encourage our realisation of the Holy Name in different ways, but Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī has given us a central thought. He quotes the <span class=\\"e3\\">Padma-purāṇa</span>, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Ataḥ Śrī-Kṛṣṇa-Nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ</span>: our senses, physical or mental, are ineligible to come in touch with the transcendental.” The Name is non-material (aprākṛta), without mundane limitation (Vaikuṇṭha). It belongs to another plane. So, nothing about Kṛṣṇa—His Name, Form, Qualities, or Pastimes—can be touched by our physical or mental senses. But when we have a serving attitude, He comes down to us of His own accord. Only then can our tongue really pronounce the Name of Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, only the physical sound of the letters of the Name can be produced. Our tongue, our hands, physical sound, all these mundane things cannot come in touch with Kṛṣṇa. Some intervening medium is necessary to connect this body with the supramundane. And that connection is our earnest desire to serve Kṛṣṇa, to satisfy Him. A bulb won’t light if there is no electricity. Only when the electrical current is there will the bulb be illumined. So, the Name may appear on the tongue and in the ear, in the mind, or in writing, but we must have the connection from Vaikuṇṭha to this mundane world. And that connection is devotional service, a functional serving attitude. That alone can connect the physical realm with Vaikuṇṭha and Vṛndāvan."},{"class":"b70","text":" Firing blank mantras"},{"class":"b43","text":" Kṛṣṇa will appear of His own accord. He will descend upon your tongue, and then your tongue will be able to chant the Name of Kṛṣṇa. A gun that has no bullet but only a blank may make some sound, but no bullet is actually fired. Similarly, chanting the Name of Kṛṣṇa without an attitude of service produces sound, but that is only tongue deep. It is like firing a gun with blanks instead of bullets. Our chanting of the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa must be surcharged with a serving temperament, the tendency to satisfy Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" Otherwise, the sound we produce is bogus. It is only an imitation or a permutation. The Holy Name cannot be experienced by our senses. It is supramental and transcendental. An ordinary sound of this mundane world cannot be the Name of Kṛṣṇa. Our ear cannot even hear the Name if that mediator, the serving attitude, is not there. The earnestness to satisfy Kṛṣṇa’s will must mediate between Kṛṣṇa and the ear, through the mind. Then only will Kṛṣṇa’s Name enter our ear and reveal to us His Form, Qualities, and Pastimes. The Holy Name is not physical, it is aprākṛta, transcendental, supramundane. Only through our service attitude will it come down to this mundane world."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our Guru Mahārāj laid the highest stress on developing a serving attitude. Otherwise, it is all bogus, all imitation. And people will say, “Oh, there is no Kṛṣṇa there. These men are hypocrites. They are only dancing and making noise; they are not surcharged with a serving spirit.” Only through service can we directly come in contact with Kṛṣṇa. The real point is to practise how to attain the spirit of service, Vaiṣṇava-sevā. The Vaiṣṇava is doing service, and we must imbibe from him the methods of attaining this serving attitude."},{"class":"b44","text":" Under the order of a devotee we must practise to give ourselves. Self-abnegation and self-dedication are necessary. And that positive thing we will receive from a devotee. If children are given pen and paper in the beginning, it will not be fruitful, so a stone is given, and on the earth they practise writing. So, in the beginning, we must try to practise how we can develop a serving attitude, dedicating habit. It is our innate wealth, and that is our solace."},{"class":"b44","text":" If we try to develop a serving attitude, the pure devotee will help us. It is said that if one is miserly, he should at least give some trash in charity to anyone. One says to a miser, “At least give some ash to others and let your hand practise giving.” So, the serving spirit is a high thing. We must practise to give ourselves in the service of Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" We must not be afraid that we are not attaining the highest form of service in Nām-bhajan, the worship of the Holy Name. We should not think, “Why have I been asked to sweep the Temple? Any ordinary man can do this.” We must not be afraid of that. It is necessary for us to acquire a service attitude. Self-giving, selflessness, and self-forgetfulness are required. It is said that Socrates is an example of self-forgetfulness and Jesus Christ is an example of self-sacrifice. And for what purpose? For the cause of the Supreme. And for that we must have a positive connection with a devotee."},{"class":"b52","text":" Under his order we will connect with the plane of service. Our energy may go to the transcendental plane only by his grace or mediation. So, our Guru Mahārāj, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur, laid ninety percent stress on developing a service attitude for preaching, and that should be our aim, whatever our position may be."}]},{"title":"Nectar of The Holy Name","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b47","text":" Nectar of The Holy Name"},{"class":"b43","text":" Not only the sound of the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa is necessary, but also the proper meaning, the substance, the spirit of the sound.

Take My Name, and perhaps he will talk with you.”"},{"class":"b43","text":" Pradyumna Miśra was hesitant, but he went and observed Rāmānanda Rāy for some time and then returned and reported to Mahāprabhu.

They do not marry, and sometimes their character is not very good. Pradyumna Miśra saw Rāmānanda Rāy training Deva-dāsīs in a very objectionable way. He was showing them how to go before the Jagannāth Deity and dance and sing. He showed them how their posture should be, how they should gesture, and how their looks should be enticing. And for such training he would sometimes even touch their private parts. So, Pradyumna Miśra told Mahāprabhu, “Seeing Rāmānanda doing all these things, I had no regard for him, so for some time I saw him busily engaged in that matter, and then I went away.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" Master of the senses"},{"class":"b43","text":" Mahāprabhu told him, “Don’t underestimate Rāmānanda Rāy. He is the master of his senses. There is not a tinge of craft in him. Even I feel trouble from sense disturbance within Me, but Rāmānanda has no such trouble. We have no direct experience that a stage can be attained where it is possible to be above mundane sense pleasure, but we have only heard through the scriptures that there is a stage when a man may transcend all these gross attachments."},{"class":"b51","text":" “This is mentioned in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> (10.33.39):"},{"class":"b60","text":" vikrīḍitaṁ vraja-vadhūbhir idañ cha viṣṇoḥ<br />śraddhānvito ’nuśṛṇuyād atha varṇayed yaḥ<br />bhaktiṁ parāṁ bhagavati pratilabhya kāmaṁ<br />hṛd-rogam āśv apahinoty achireṇa dhīraḥ"},{"class":"b43","text":" “One who hears with firm faith the supramundane amorous affairs of Lord Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs, as described by a pure devotee of the Lord, soon becomes freed from mundane lust and achieves divine love of Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b69","text":" “One may be engaged bodily in such activities, while his heart is elsewhere.

Then, when it was late, his servants came twice, thrice, to ask him to take bath and eat his dinner, and finally, he had to leave the talk and go.

What I taught to Rūpa and Sanātan, I heard from Rāmānanda.” It is mentioned that Mahāprabhu took dīkṣā, initiation, from Īśvara Purī; for preaching purposes He took sannyās, the renounced order, from Keśava Bhāratī; and for entrance into the transcendental Pastimes of Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvan, He took rāga-mārg initiation from Rāmānanda Rāy. Of course, Īśvara Purī, Keśava Bhāratī, and Rāmānanda Rāy never thought of themselves as the Guru of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. But it was seen that Mahāprabhu treated Rāmānanda with some respect. It is mentioned in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Chaitanya-charitāmṛta</span> (Madhya-līlā, 8.204) that if one wants to enter into the spontaneous devotion of Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes in Vraja, it is required that he take shelter of a confidential maidservant in conjugal mellow, madhura-rasa (<span class=\\"e3\\">sakhī vinā ei līlāya anyera nāhi gati</span>).They are masters of that situation. The whole storehouse of this madhura-līlā is in the hands of those maidservants. Only they can give it to others. In madhura-rasa, the Guru is seen in the form and spirit of a sakhī, a maidservant of Rādhārāṇī (guru-rūpa-sakhī).

The fullest engagement of all our senses was announced there on the banks of the Godāvarī: “Your senses are not to be rejected. If you can give up the spirit of exploitation and renunciation, then your senses will have their fulfilment with Kṛṣṇa. Those tendencies bar your approach to Kṛṣṇa. To properly approach Kṛṣṇa, you will have to utilise your senses to the fullest extent.” That was dealt with on the banks of the Godāvarī."},{"class":"b70","text":" The ultimate goal of life"},{"class":"b43","text":" There, in His famous conversations with Rāmānanda Rāy, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu began the approach to pure devotional service in a general and comprehensive way. This is recorded in the Madhya-līlā of <span class=\\"e3\\">Chaitanya-charitāmṛta</span> (8.51–313). He asked Rāmānanda Rāy, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Prabhu kahe, ‘Paḍa śloka sādhyera nirṇaya’</span>: what is the ultimate goal of life?

According to your present position, you have to discharge your duties on one condition: you must do them without remuneration. If you go on with your duties in varṇāśram-dharma, without any mundane aim, you can achieve Viṣṇu-bhakti, devotion to God. This is confirmed in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Viṣṇu-purāṇa</span> (3.8.9):"},{"class":"b60","text":" varṇāśramāchāra-vatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān<br />viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam"},{"class":"b71","text":" “The only way to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu, is to worship Him by properly executing one’s prescribed duties in the social system of varṇa and āśram.” Here, Rāmānanda Rāy says that Viṣṇu-bhakti, adherence to the Lord who is permeating everything, is the object and ultimate destination of our life. This is the Vāsudev conception: everything is in Him, and He is everywhere. Rāmānanda explained that from our local interests, we must come to embrace the general interest, and that must reach the level of Viṣṇu consciousness—Viṣṇu-bhakti. Our submission to Viṣṇu, the internal spirit who is everywhere, is the object of life. We must connect with Him and live accordingly, not a phenomenal life, but a spiritual life pertaining to a deeper, more subtle plane."},{"class":"b70","text":" Devotion mixed with desires"},{"class":"b43","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu said, “This is superficial; go deeper.” Of course, it may be thought that actual theistic life begins from here, giving up the special, local purpose, and acting for a universal purpose as already ordered and programmed in the Vedas and Upaniṣads. But Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu said, “This is superficial; go deeper.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, Rāmānanda Rāy said, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Kṛṣṇe karmārpaṇa—sarva-sādhya-sāra</span>: to offer the results of one’s activities to Kṛṣṇa is the essence of all perfection.” In varṇāśram-dharma, it is the fashion that people are generally engaged in external activities and do not care to give up the fruits of their action. Even if they do, they have no direct consciousness of Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa. They worship the goddess Durgā, perform the śrāddha funeral ceremony, and execute so many other religious practices. Indirectly, it is ultimately connected with Viṣṇu. They may or may not know how, but the link is there. That is the general conception of varṇāśram, but here, Rāmānanda says that it will be better to have direct consciousness that Kṛṣṇa is the authority. All the results of whatever we do within the varṇāśram social system must be given to Kṛṣṇa. If we perform all our physical, social, national, and spiritual activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then we can approach the fulfilment of our goal in life."},{"class":"b69","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu said, “This is superficial; go deeper.” Then Rāmānanda Rāy revealed new light, quoting the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (18.66), “<span class=\\"e3\\">Sarva-dharmān parityajya Mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span>: give up all your duties, and just surrender to Me.” We must be particular with the object of life, not the external activities of varṇāśram. Less importance should be given to the form of our activity; whether I am a king, a brāhmaṇ intellectual, or a worker does not matter. We may think, “I have this sort of duty; I have that sort of duty”, but that does not matter very much. We must have no attachment for that. The king may leave his kingdom and take to a brahmanical life of renunciation and austerity. A śūdra may give up his labour, become a beggar, and chant the Name of Kṛṣṇa. A brāhmaṇ may give up his performance of sacrifice and become a mendicant. So, we are to be particular about the aim of life, not the form of our duty. We must exclusively devote ourselves to the cause of the Lord, ignoring our present paraphernalia and duty."},{"class":"b70","text":" Knowledge and devotion"},{"class":"b50","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu said, “This is also superficial; go ahead—deeper.” Then, Rāmānanda Rāy explained jñāna-miśra-bhakti, devotional service mixed with knowledge, by quoting from the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (18.54), where Kṛṣṇa says:"},{"class":"b60","text":" brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śochati na kāṅkṣati<br />samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām"},{"class":"b43","text":" One who has come to the stage of identifying himself with spirit above matter has nothing to do with this mundane world. Any loss or gain in this mundane world is of no use to him. He is spirit; his prospect is in the world of soul, and he has nothing to do with this material world, whether it is laudable or blamable. He is already settled in the consciousness that he is soul proper and has nothing to do with matter, so within himself he feels satisfaction. He is ātmārāma: self-content; he neither mourns, nor aspires for anything. If something is lost, does he mourn? No. He thinks, “This is nothing; it is only matter.” And when something is gained, he is not overly cheerful because it is only matter; it is unnecessary and unimportant. Now true devotional service can begin. His soul can begin living in the spiritual plane, with a pure serving attitude, unmixed with any mundane aspiration. When one attains the spiritual platform, he gets the opportunity to practise a higher type of service."},{"class":"b69","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu said, “This is also superficial. Such a person is only on the verge of devotional service; he has no substantial touch of devotion. He has not entered the domain of bhakti; he is just waiting in the marginal position, at the door. He may attain bhakti, but he has not yet achieved it. His negative forces are finished, but still, he is just at the door; he has not yet entered. He may enter; he may not enter. From there, if he gets anything, it will be pure, but he is still at the door."},{"class":"b70","text":" Beyond spirit, “Go deeper’’"},{"class":"b43","text":" Rāmānanda Rāy then said, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva</span>: it is a very difficult thing to cross the charm of knowledge.” We think, “I want to understand everything first, and then I shall act.” Calculation and an underlying suspicion is there. Before we act, we want to know everything fully; only then will we risk our capital. The ego, the “I”, is very strong, and he wants to have an account of his loss and gain. He thinks, “I am the master. The key is in my hand. I want to test everything. I want to know it all. I know what is good for me.” So, we think ourselves masters, not servants, and from the position of a master we make our enquiry."},{"class":"b69","text":" But this calculating mentality must be given up if we at all want to enter into the domain of the Lord, where everything is superior to us. No one there will care to come to us with an explanation, thinking that we are their master. They will not reassure us by saying, “Yes, there will be no loss; your gain will be big.” We may think, “I am an independent separate entity, so in my account there must be no loss. I must stand here with my head erect”, but that won’t do. We are to go there as slaves, not masters. That sort of mentality is necessary. We must bow down our heads, not that with our heads erect we will march over everything. But everything there is superior in quality to us."},{"class":"b70","text":" Divine slavery"},{"class":"b43","text":" So, we have to enter into that transcendental land where even the earth, water, air, and whatever we will find is made of higher materials than we ourselves are made of. They are all Guru, and we are disciples. They are all masters, and we are servants. We have to enter the land where everything is our master. We will have to submit; that will be our real qualification. What we will be ordered to do, we will have to do. We are not to exercise our brain so much there. The brain has no room there; they are all brainier than we. Our brain is unnecessary there; only our hands are necessary. Menial labour is necessary there. Brain there is enough. We are to enter that land if we like. It is a land of slavery for us. So, we are to hatefully dismiss our brains, and taking only our hearts, we must approach and enter that land."},{"class":"b44","text":" We should think, “I am as insignificant as a mosquito”, just as Lord Brahmā did when he went to Dvārakā to visit Lord Kṛṣṇa. And it is not only for the time being; not that one will accept a humble attitude, finish his work, and then come back. No. We will have to accept such an insignificant position eternally. Of course, we may expect to be educated about Kṛṣṇa consciousness: how it is good, how it is great, how it is useful to us. We will be allowed paripraśna, honest enquiry. In the transcendental realm, everyone is our friend. They will come to help us, to make us understand that devotional service is beautiful, and that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the best form of life. Our aspiration and purity of purpose is to be valued, not our external position. The recruiters from that side will consider our purity of purpose, not so much our present position and capacity."},{"class":"b44","text":" And although apparently it seems that we are going to be slaves, the result is just the opposite. If you can accept such an attitude of surrender and slavery, then He who can never be conquered will be conquered. Friends will come and help you. The sādhus will come and make you understand that we should become slaves, that Kṛṣṇa likes His slaves very much. He is the Master of slaves, and sometimes He wants to become the slave of His slaves (<span class=\\"e3\\">Gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ</span>). This is the key to success, and we can achieve the highest gain through this attitude."},{"class":"b69","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu told Rāmānanda Rāy, “Yes, this is true. The unconquerable is conquered by surrender. We can capture Him. I accept this as the beginning plane of divine love: by giving we can get as much as we risk. As much as we risk to give ourselves, so much we can demand from that unconquerable infinite.” Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu said, “I accept this as the beginning of śuddha-bhakti, pure devotional service. But go farther.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" The science of rasa"},{"class":"b43","text":" Rāmānanda Rāy explained that from there pure devotional service develops in a crude form, in a general way. And when it is more mature, it must take the shape of śānta, neutrality; dāsya, servitorship; sakhya, friendship; vātsalya, paternal affection; and madhura-rasa, conjugal love. In śānta-rasa, there is adherence, niṣṭhā; one thinks, “I cannot withdraw myself from this consciousness of continuous submission to the truth.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" Neutrality develops into dāsya-rasa, the desire to do some service. When a devotee is not satisfied by only sitting, showing loyalty to the Supreme Authority, he wants to be utilised by Him. He awaits the Lord’s order, praying that the Lord may give him some engagement. When a devotee has such deep penetration that he wants to be utilised in any way by the Lord, that is known as dāsya-rasa, or devotion in the mood of service. Then there is sakhya-rasa, devotional service in friendship."},{"class":"b70","text":" God the Friend"},{"class":"b43","text":" When, in dāsya-rasa, confidence is added to service, then it becomes a little superior. Generally, old servants who are faithful become confidential servants. So, when the confidential stage is added to service, it becomes sakhya-rasa, or devotional service as a friend of the Lord. First, there is niṣṭhā, adherence, submission; then the devotee wants to be utilised for His satisfaction; then there is confidential utilisation; and then it comes to friendly service, sakhya-rasa. In Vaikuṇṭha, where Lord Nārāyaṇ is served in calculative devotion, only śānta-rasa, dāsya-rasa, and half of sakhya-rasa are seen. Full confidence is not possible there. Awe, reverence, splendor, grandeur, pomp, apprehension—all these vanish when we develop a more confidential relationship with the Supreme Lord. At that time, the object of our worship or love changes in another way."},{"class":"b69","text":" Then from Vaikuṇṭha, we feel attraction for Ayodhyā, the divine abode of Lord Rāmachandra, where there is neutrality, servitorship, and friendship with Vibhīṣaṇ and Sugrīva. There, we can also trace vātsalya-rasa, parental love of Godhead."},{"class":"b70","text":" God the Son"},{"class":"b71","text":" In vātsalya-rasa, confidence has developed to the peculiar stage in which the servitors think themselves promoted to the post of protecting the object of their veneration. Filial affection is also service. Although it seems that the parents are masters of the situation, controlling the Lord as their son, sometimes chastising and punishing Him, this is a superficial view. If we can enter into the depth of their service, we shall find an incomparable love of a most peculiar type. On the surface, they are engaged in punishing and rebuking the Lord; underground, they are full of interest for the welfare of the object of their service. Vātsalya, or parental love of Godhead, is a peculiar type of divine love. We see a very light type of vātsalya in Ayodhyā, so it is almost ignored."},{"class":"b70","text":" Mathurā: the Kṛṣṇa conception"},{"class":"b43","text":" Rūpa Goswāmī leaped from Vaikuṇṭha to Mathurā in one stride. In his <span class=\\"e3\\">Upadeśamṛta</span> (9), he writes, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Vaikuṇṭhāj janito varā madhu-purī tatrāpi rāsotsavād</span>: Mathurā is superior to Vaikuṇṭha because Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa appeared there.” It is there that everything is shown in a clear and substantial way. In Mathurā, we find the Kṛṣṇa conception of Godhead. In one stride, he has come from Vaikuṇṭha to the Kṛṣṇa conception, but Sanātan Goswāmī has filled up the gap. In his book, <span class=\\"e3\\">Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta</span>, he says that on the way to Mathurā there is Ayodhyā, the spiritual kingdom of Lord Rāma, and there we find sakhya and vātsalya-rasa."},{"class":"b44","text":" But Rūpa Goswāmī goes to Mathurā at once. He says, “Come to Mathurā; here you will find sakhya and vātsalya-rasa clearly visible. He has shown how sakhya-rasa service is present there. The devotees there are playing with Kṛṣṇa, sometimes climbing on His shoulders, and perhaps sometimes even giving Him a slap. But although they may mix with Him in this way, their heart is full of a peculiar type of service attitude. That is the criterion; they may give up their lives a thousand times to take a thorn out of His sole. They can sacrifice themselves a thousand times for the slightest satisfaction of their friend. They consider Him a thousand times more valuable than their own life. In vātsalya-rasa also, the criterion is similar. For the slightest interest of the object of their veneration, they can give their lives millions of times. Such affection is found there."},{"class":"b69","text":" And then, from vātsalya, it progresses to conjugal love (madhura-rasa), the all-comprehensive rasa which includes adherence (śānta-niṣṭhā), service (dāsya), friendly confidence (sakhya), and parental love (vātsalya-rasa). But the wholesale dedication of every atom of our existence for Kṛṣṇa’s satisfaction is found in madhura-rasa, which includes all other rasas."},{"class":"b70","text":" Paramour love"},{"class":"b43","text":" And madhura-rasa is more enhanced when it is couched in the form of parakīya, or paramour relationship. In parakīya-rasa, the gopīs risk everything for the service of Kṛṣṇa. Parakīya-rasa takes two forms: in one, there is no obligation of anything; the union may happen or may not happen. So, because their meeting is very rare, it becomes even sweeter. There is another kind of parakīya-rasa: we are told that ordinary food is not palatable to Kṛṣṇa, but when He takes food by stealing, that is more tasteful to Him. If we can follow this art, that may also be applied in the case of parakīya-rasa. “I am deceiving the party, getting what I want. I am stealing the property of someone else.” That sort of posing becomes more tasteful to the subjective party."},{"class":"b44","text":" And the dedicated party risks everything: their good name, society, future, and even the dictation of the religious scriptures. They take a wholesale risk, just as one time, when we were in Madras, the King of Jaipur gave some money for the construction of a Temple. The money was sent to our head office in Calcutta. Out of five thousand rupees, the first installment was one thousand rupees, and the construction work was begun by sending a worker from our main centre. Then, Mādhav Mahārāj and I were sent to Madras, where we heard that the king would soon come. In order to show him that some work had been done, we raised the construction to some extent, so the king could be told, “Your money has been spent, and now the next installment is necessary.” In order to do this, we incurred a debt. We took a loan for bricks and other things and raised the construction to a higher level."},{"class":"b44","text":" When we wrote this to our Guru Mahārāj, we had some apprehension that he would chastise us, “Why have you taken this loan?” Instead of that, he gave us his appreciation. “You have risked your future in the service of Kṛṣṇa. You have taken a loan, and that means you have to pay off that loan, so you have engaged your future energy in the service of Kṛṣṇa. You will have to collect money and pay off the loan, so there is service with risk for the future.” The gopīs consciously risked their future: “We have disobeyed our superior persons and the directions of the Vedas; what we do is neither approved by society, nor by the religious books. Our future is dark.” Still, they could not but serve Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b69","text":" So, <span class=\\"e3\\">Vaikuṇṭhāj janito varā madhu-purī tatrāpi rāsotsavād</span>. <span class=\\"e3\\">Janito</span> means vātsalya-rasa and madhura-rasa in Vṛndāvan: <span class=\\"e3\\">Rādhā-kuṇḍam ihāpi Gokula-pateḥ</span>. In the madhura-rasa also, three groups are shown: Vṛndāvan in general, selected groups in Govardhan, and the highest group in Rādhā Kuṇḍa. All these things have been shown in the conversation between Rāmānanda Rāy and Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b70","text":" Rādhā: queen of the gopīs"},{"class":"b71","text":" After this, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu said, “Go further.” Then, Rāmānanda Rāy began to explain the kind of service rendered by Rādhārāṇī in madhura-rasa. Her devotional service is categorically higher than that of all the other gopīs. <span class=\\"e3\\">Rādhām ādhāya hṛdaye tatyāja Vraja-sundarīḥ </span>(<span class=\\"e3\\">Gīta-govinda</span>: 3.1 by Jayadev Goswāmī). The whole group of gopīs can be cancelled for only one—Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. What peculiar type of service may come from Her? And Kṛṣṇa, the Original Personality of Godhead (Svayam-rūpa), is only by the side of Rādhārāṇī. By the side of other gopīs, that is prābhava-prakāśa, a plenary expansion, not Svayam-rūpa, the original form. Such is the quality of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. We should show our highest reverence to this highest ideal of devotional service."},{"class":"b70","text":" Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa: union in separation"},{"class":"b71","text":" Then, the last question came from Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu: “Can you think of anything more than this?” Then, Rāmānanda Rāy said, “You asked me to quote scripture to support whatever I say, but here I won’t be able to quote scripture from anywhere. Still, I have a new feeling within me, and if You would like to know that, I can explain it to You.” In this way, one song was composed by Rāmānanda Rāy. He introduced this song by saying, “Whether or not it will be pleasing to You, I do not know, but it seems to me that there is a stage which is even better than the meeting of Rādhā and Govinda.” There is a stage where both of Them, the positive and negative are combined, no individual consciousness is clear, and one is searching another in self-forgetfulness. This searching of one party by the other is very strong and intense. This seems to be a more highly elevated love: union in separation. Rādhā and Govinda are so intense in Their search of one another that even They have no consciousness of whether They have each other. Rādhārāṇī sometimes experiences that even while Kṛṣṇa is present before Her, She fears losing Him; that feeling becomes as intense as if She has lost Him. They are together, but the apprehension that one may lose the other makes their meeting intolerably painful, just as a mother is always alert about the safety of her son (<span class=\\"e3\\">aniṣṭāśaṅkīni bandhu-hṛdayāni bhavanti hi</span>). A mother thinks, “Oh, my son is out—is he in an accident?” This fear of separation is the symptom of deep love."},{"class":"b70","text":" Śrī Chaitanya-avatār"},{"class":"b71","text":" Rāmānanda Rāy’s composition gave a hint about the divine appearance of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu in which both Rādhā and Govinda are combined, and it is as if They are unconscious of Their separate existence. One is searching the other. Kṛṣṇa Himself is overflowing with the feelings of Rādhārāṇī, and They are so deeply embraced that one is lost in the other. Then, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu put His palm over the mouth of Rāmānanda Rāy and told him, “No further.” <span class=\\"e3\\">‘Rasa-rāja’, ‘Mahābhāva’—dui eka rūpa</span>. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the fountainhead of all pleasure, and Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the embodiment of ecstatic love of Godhead. These two forms are united as one in Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b70","text":" Rasarāj: Ecstasy Himself"},{"class":"b43","text":" Mahāprabhu replied, “Oh, because you are a cent per cent devotee, wherever you cast your glance you see only Kṛṣṇa, nothing else. The object of your interest is represented everywhere.” Rāmānanda Rāy said, “My Lord, don’t deceive me in this way. You have come here so graciously to purify this mean person, and if You act diplomatically now, it will not look well for You. I won’t hear what You say; come out with Your real position. Who are You?” Mahāprabhu said, “By dint of your loving devotion, you can know everything in this world; nothing can be concealed from your loving eye.” <span class=\\"e3\\">Premāñjana-chchhurita-bhakti-vilochanena</span>."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, Mahāprabhu revealed Himself: “When you see Me to be externally of a golden colour, it is not so. It is by the touch of the colour of Rādhārāṇī. And who can Rādhārāṇī touch and closely embrace? She will never touch anyone except Kṛṣṇa. So, now you know who I am: Rasarāj—Ecstasy Himself—and Mahābhāva—the one who can taste that highest rasa. See how They mingle together!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Rāmānanda Rāy fainted and fell flat on the floor. He could not keep his senses. Then, by the touch of His hand, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu again brought him to his senses. Rāmānanda returned to his previous stage of consciousness and saw a sannyāsī sitting before him. After a short pause, Mahāprabhu said, “Remain here, I am going.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" Afterwards, Rāmānanda Rāy and Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu had some other talks, and Mahāprabhu said, “Rāmānanda, as long as I live, I want your company.” Rāmānanda replied, “Yes, I must take shelter of Your divine feet and live there for the rest of my life.” Rāmānanda later made arrangements with the King of Orissa to retire from his post as Governor of Madras and came to Jagannāth Purī. For almost two years, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu wandered about the holy places of Southern and Western India and at last returned to Purī. There they again met."},{"class":"b70","text":" Transcendental madness"},{"class":"b43","text":" After this, Mahāprabhu went to Vṛndāvan through Bengal. Six years passed, and Advaita Prabhu almost gave leave to Mahāprabhu, saying, “Our Pastimes of introducing the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa are finished.” Then, Mahāprabhu continuously showed Rādhārāṇī’s mood of tasting Kṛṣṇa-prema, ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa, for twelve years. Svarūp Dāmodar and Rāmānanda Rāy, who are Lalitā and Viśākhā, the two principle gopī assistants of Rādhārāṇī, were Mahāprabhu’s most important company during that time. There, so many things about the deep feelings of divine love have been shown. It has never been found in the history of the world or even expressed in any scripture how such intense love within can produce such corresponding symptoms on the surface. That was shown by Rādhārāṇī and later shown by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" It was shown by Mahāprabhu in His practices also, how Kṛṣṇa-prema, love of Kṛṣṇa, can play a man like a doll. Sometimes His legs and hands would enter inconceivably into His body, and sometimes His joints would disconnect and His transcendental body would appear elongated. Sometimes His whole body would become white, and He would lay unconscious, breathing so slowly that His breath could not be traced. In this way, He exhibited many amazing symptoms of ecstasy."},{"class":"b51","text":" Svarūp Dāmodar, the personal secretary of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, has explained the meaning of His appearance in his memoirs, which were recorded in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Chaitanya-charitāmṛta </span>of Kavirāj Goswāmī. He writes:"},{"class":"b60","text":" rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī śaktir asmād<br />ekātmānāv api bhuvi purā deha-bhedaṁ gatau tau<br />chaitanyākhyaṁ prakaṭam adhunā tad-dvayaṁ chaikyam āptaṁ<br />rādhā-bhāva-dyuti-suvalitaṁ naumi kṛṣṇa-svarūpam"},{"class":"b50","text":" Sometimes Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are combined; sometimes They are separate. They are separate in Dvāpar-yuga, and in Kali-yuga they are combined as Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. Both are eternal expressions of the same Absolute Truth. Summer, autumn, winter, and spring continue in a cyclic order; it cannot be said that summer is the beginning and winter comes later. So, the Pastimes of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are eternally being enacted. In ancient times, sometimes Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa divided Themselves and showed Their Pastimes; again both of Them, the potency and the owner of the potency, are combined and closely embraced as Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. The predominating and the predominated moiety are mixed, and an extraordinary ecstatic feeling is there. Kṛṣṇa is overpowered by His potency, and He Himself is searching after His own Self: Kṛṣṇasya ātmānusandhāna. Kṛṣṇa Himself is engaged in the search for Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Reality the Beautiful. The influence of Rādhārāṇī over Kṛṣṇa has transformed Him into a devotee, and He is searching Himself. Sweetness is tasting Itself and becoming mad. And it is living sweetness—not dead or static, but dynamic ecstasy, sweetness endowed with life. And He is tasting Himself, the personification of happiness, ecstasy, and beauty, and dancing in madness. And His performance of kīrtan means distributing that ecstasy to others. The ultimate sweetness, or ānanda, is such that no other thing exists that can taste itself and express its own happiness with such intensity.

Mahāprabhu’s dancing indicates that He is full of ecstasy, and His kīrtan is distribution of that rasa. So, if we scientifically search out who Mahāprabhu is, we cannot but find that He is the Ultimate Reality. He is mad in tasting His own internal nectar, and His dancing is the outcome of His transcendental ecstasy. And He is chanting, distributing that to others. So, studying quite closely the character of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, we cannot but think that He is the Supreme Absolute Truth in its fullest and most dynamic expression.”"}]},{"title":"","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b36","text":" Explanation of the Logo <br />of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh"},{"class":"b37","text":" by His Divine Grace"},{"class":"b73","text":" Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj"},{"class":"b43","text":" Om is the very gist of gāyatrī, and from that Om comes merciful rays, like the rays of the sun.
