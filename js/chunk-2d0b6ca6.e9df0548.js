From Brahmā the knowledge descended to Nārad, from Nārad to Vyāsadev, from Vyāsadev to Madhva, and in this process of disciplic succession the transcendental knowledge was transmitted by one disciple to another till it reached Lord Gaurāṅga, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya, who posed as the disciple and successor of Śrī Īśvar Purī. The present Āchāryadev is the tenth disciplic representative from Śrī Rūpa Goswāmī, the original representative of Lord Chaitanya who preached this transcendental tradition in its fullness. The knowledge that we receive from our Gurudev is not different from that imparted by God Himself and the succession of the Āchāryas in the preceptorial line of Brahmā.

Actual performance of service to the Absolute under the guidance of the Āchārya is the only vehicle by which we can assimilate transcendental knowledge. Today’s meeting for offering our humble services and homage to the feet of the Āchāryadev will enable us to be favoured with the capacity of assimilating the transcendental knowledge so kindly transmitted by him to all persons without distinction."},{"class":"b44","text":" Gentlemen, although it is imperfectly that we have been enabled, by his grace, to understand the sublime messages of our Āchāryadev, we must admit that we have realised definitely that the divine message from his holy lips is the congenial thing for suffering humanity. All of us should hear him patiently. If we listen to the transcendental sound without unnecessary opposition, he will surely have mercy upon us. The Āchārya’s message is to take us back to our original home, back to God. Let me repeat, therefore, that we should hear him patiently, follow him in the measure of our conviction, and bow down at his lotus feet for releasing us from our present causeless unwillingness for serving the Absolute and all souls."},{"class":"b44","text":" Sitting at the feet of the Āchāryadev, let us try to understand from this transcendental source of knowledge what we are, what is this universe, what is God, and what is our relationship with Him. The message of Lord Chaitanya is the message for the living entities and the message of the living world. Lord Chaitanya did not bother Himself for the upliftment of this dead world, which is suitably named Martyaloka, the world where everything is destined to die. He appeared before us four hundred and fifty years ago to tell us something of the transcendental universe, where everything is permanent and everything is for the service of the Absolute. But recently Lord Chaitanya has been misrepresented by some unscrupulous persons, and the highest philosophy of the Lord has been misinterpreted to be the cult of the lowest type of society. We are glad to announce tonight that our Āchāryadev, with his usual kindness, saved us from this horrible type of degradation, and therefore we bow down at his lotus feet with all humility."},{"class":"b44","text":" We are happy that we have been relieved of this horrible type of malady by the mercy of His Divine Grace. He is our ‘eye-opener’, our eternal father, our eternal preceptor, and our eternal guide.

To err is inevitable for all, being not perfect. Still, no one wants to remain imperfect. There is an element within all that is animate that tends towards perfection.

Our limited capacity and tendency for perfection makes room for the guide or Guru."},{"class":"b44","text":" The imperfect is not so if it is not in need of help, and that also from beyond itself. The perfect is not perfect if He cannot assert Himself or help others, and that too, of His own accord. So the guidance to perfection or Absolute Truth is necessarily a function of the Absolute Himself, and the divine agent through whom this function manifests is Śrī Guru or the divine guide."},{"class":"b44","text":" For a seeker of the Absolute Truth, submission to the Guru is unavoidable. A class of thinkers believe, however, that when scientific research is possible, why cannot higher spiritual knowledge also be evolved from within? Such people are ignorant of the most essential nature of Absolute Knowledge, that He alone is the Absolute Subject and all else including ourselves constitutionally stand only as an object to His omniscient vision. It is impossible for the eye to see the mind; it can have some connection with the mind only when the latter cares to mind it. In a similar way, our connection with absolute knowledge depends mainly on His sweet will. We must solely depend on His agent, or the Spiritual Master, through whom He likes to distribute Himself."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our human society with its finest culture forms but an infinitesimal part of the dynamic Absolute. How, except by the direct and positive method of revelation, dare we hope to comprehend or evolve any conception of the supernatural knowledge of the unconditioned Infinite? All intellectual giants prove themselves but pygmies before the absolute omniscient omnipotence who reserves the right to give Himself away through His own agents alone."},{"class":"b44","text":" To our best knowledge and sincerity, however, we should see not to submit to a false agent. Here of course, we can’t help ourselves very much; because in our present state we are mainly guided by our previous saṁskār or acquired nature. “Birds of the same feather flock together.” Yet, although we are generally overpowered by habit, there is still the possibility of free choice to a certain extent, especially in the human species, otherwise correction becomes impossible, and punishment mere vengeance. Reality can assert itself. Light does not require darkness for its positive proof. The sun by itself can establish its supremacy over all other lights. Before an open and unbiased eye, the Sad-guru (real guide) shines above all professors of phenomenon."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrī Guru manifests himself mainly in a twofold way—as the director from within and the preceptor from without. Both functions of the Absolute help an individual soul—a disciple—to reach the absolute goal. In our fallen state we cannot catch the proper direction to the inner guide, so the merciful manifestation of the preceptor without is our sole help and hope. But at the same time it is only by the grace of the Guru within that we can recognise the real preceptor without and submit to his holy feet."},{"class":"b44","text":" A bona fide disciple must always remain fully awake to the fact that his highest spiritual fortune is but a gracious grant from the Absolute Lord, and not a matter of right to be demanded or fought out. Constitutionally, we are equipped only to be proper recipients of God’s favour. In this connection it should be clearly understood that an individual soul can never be substantially the same as the Absolute Person. Not even in his liberated or fully realised condition can an individual soul be one with Godhead. The misconception of oneness has been introduced from the slothful nondiscrimination of the Absolute Personality from the luminous orb around His eternal, spiritual, and blissful home. In fact, an individual soul constitutes only a part of a particular power of intermediate value of the Supreme Lord, and as such he is capable of being converted from both sides. He differs from the Absolute Entity both in quantity and quality, and is merely a dependent entity on the Absolute. In other words, the Absolute Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Master, and an individual jīva-soul is His constitutional subordinate or servant."},{"class":"b44","text":" Such a relationship is constant and really wholesome for the jīva. The apprehension of slavery does not arise because of his free choice and immense positive gain. The freedom and individuality of the jīva are not only unharmed by surrender to the Absolute Good, but they really thrive in Him alone. Individual freedom and interest are the part and parcel of those who are of the Absolute, and so they are quite at home there, as a fish is at home in water or an animal in a healthy atmosphere. But the freedom as well as all other qualities of the Supreme Personality are unlimited and transcendental, and so only by their partial functions do they harmonise all relative entities."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrī Guru is not exclusively the same as the Supreme Lord Himself, but he fully represents the essence of the whole normal potency and embodies the most comprehensive and excellent service and favour of the Lord. As he is the fittest servitor of the Lord, he is empowered by the Lord to reinstate all misguided souls to their best interest. So Guru is the divine messenger of immortal hope and joy in this mortal and miserable world. His advent is the most auspicious and happy event to the suffering animation and can be compared to the rising of the morning star that can guide the traveller lost in the desert. A gentle touch of Śrī Guru’s merciful hand can wipe away the incessant tears from all weeping eyes. A patriot or philanthropist makes the problem only worse in his frantic and futile attempt to alleviate the deep-rooted pain of a suffering soul, as an ignorant doctor does in eagerly handling an unfortunate patient. Oh the day when this poor soul realises the causeless grace of Śrī Gurudev."},{"class":"b68","text":" Swāmī B.R.

This material world is a jungle of perplexities, where the soul has accepted so many different kinds of bodies in different types of consciousness.

Manu says that the trees are in such a hopeless position as a result of their own karma. Their feelings of pain and pleasure are similar to ours; their souls are not of a lower standard. Still, they are in such a deplorable position as a result of their own karma. They have no one to blame but themselves. This is the state of affairs in this external world."},{"class":"b69","text":" We are living in an environment which is afflicted with serious misconception, misunderstanding, misguidance, and misbehaviour. How are we to ascertain what is good and what is bad, what we should aspire after and what we should reject? Innumerable alternatives have thronged in a crowd, coming to influence us. And when this area, covered by illusion and influenced by misunderstanding, is filled with such diversity, how can we hope to know the infinite spiritual world of Vaikuṇṭha?

How important is a real Guru who can guide us to our real welfare."},{"class":"b51","text":" We are in the midst of different forces that are drawing us, attracting us towards different directions, so proper guidance is the most valuable and the most important thing for all of us. If we accept direction from anywhere and everywhere, we will be misguided. Therefore, we must be careful to get proper direction. That direction has been given by Kṛṣṇa in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (4.34):"},{"class":"b60","text":" tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā<br />upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ"},{"class":"b71","text":" “To understand transcendental knowledge, you must approach a self-realised soul, accept him as your Spiritual Master, and take initiation from him.

The standard to measure truth or untruth must come not from a vitiated, vulnerable plane, but from a real plane. And to realise that, we must have these three qualifications: praṇipāt, paripraśna, and sevā. <span class=\\"e3\\">Praṇipāt</span> means we must surrender to this knowledge, for it is not an ordinary class of knowledge which as a subject we can make our object; it is supersubjective. We may be the subjects in this mundane world, but we will have to become objects to be handled by the superknowledge of that plane."},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Praṇipāt</span> means that one approaches a Spiritual Master, saying, “I am finished with the experience of this external world; I have no charm for anything in this plane, where I have already travelled. Now I am offering myself exclusively at your altar. I want to have your grace.” In this mood we should approach that higher knowledge."},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Paripraśna</span> means honest, sincere enquiry. We must enquire not with the tendency of discussion or in the mood of argument, but all our efforts should be concentrated in a positive line to understand the truth, without the spirit of doubt and suspicion. With full attention we should try to understand that truth, because it is coming from a higher plane of reality that we have never known."},{"class":"b44","text":" Finally, there is sevā, service. This is the most important thing. We are trying to gain this knowledge not so we can get the help of that plane, not so we can utilise that experience for living here; rather we must give our pledge to serve that plane. Only with this attitude may we approach that plane of knowledge. We shall serve that higher knowledge; we won’t try to make it serve us. Otherwise, we won’t be allowed to enter into that domain. Absolute knowledge won’t come to serve this lower plane. We must offer ourselves to be used by Him, not that we shall try to use Him in our own selfish way, to satisfy our lower purpose."},{"class":"b44","text":" With the mood of service we shall dedicate ourselves to Him; not that He will dedicate Himself to satisfy our lower animal purpose. So, with this attitude we shall seek the plane of real knowledge and receive the standard understanding. And then we can know what is what and have a proper estimation of our environment."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is Vedic culture. Absolute knowledge has always been imparted by this process alone and never by the intellectual approach. Śrīla Prabhupād Bhakti Siddhānta used to give the analogy of the bee: honey is in a bottle, the cork is in place, and the bee has taken his seat on the glass. He tries to taste the honey by licking the bottle. But, just as the bee cannot taste the honey by licking the outside of the glass bottle, the intellect cannot approach the world of spirit. We may think that we have attained it, but that is not possible: a barrier is there, like the glass. Intellectual achievement is not real achievement of higher knowledge. Only through faith, sincerity, and dedication can we approach that higher realm and become a member. We can enter that higher plane only if they grant us a visa and admit us. Then we can enter that land of divine living."},{"class":"b51","text":" So, a candidate must have these three qualifications before he can approach the truth which is on the higher plane of Absolute Reality. He can approach the Absolute Truth only with an attitude of humility, sincerity, and dedication. There are similar statements in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> and the Vedas.

Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Prabhupād used to always say, “You have come here cutting a return ticket.” We must not approach the Spiritual Master with that attitude. Rather, we should think that we have seen everything, that we have full experience of this mortal world, and that we have nothing to aspire after here. With this clear consciousness, we should approach the Guru. That is the only way for us to live. This world is mortal. There is no means, no possibility of living here, and yet the will to live is an innate tendency everywhere."},{"class":"b44","text":" “I only want to live and to save myself. I am running to the real shelter.” With this earnestness, the disciple will bring his Spiritual Master the necessary materials for sacrifice. He won’t go to his Spiritual Master only to trouble the Guru but will approach him with his own necessities already supplied. He will go there with his own bed and baggage. Not that he will show some kindness to the Spiritual Master and give him name and fame by becoming his disciple."},{"class":"b44","text":" And what will be the Spiritual Master’s position? He will be well-versed in the revealed truth, not in ordinary information. Revelation in many shades has been spread in the world from the upper realm, but the Guru must have some spacious, graphic knowledge. He must have extensive knowledge about the revealed truth. And he must always be practising real spiritual life. His activities are all connected with spirit, not with the mundane world. He is concerned with Brahma, the plane which can accommodate everything, the fundamental basis of everything (<span class=\\"e3\\">Brahma-niṣṭham</span>). Not that he is leading his life with any mortal, mundane reference. He always lives in the transcendental plane and keeps himself in connection with that plane his whole life.

Dīkṣā, or initiation, is a process by which we are given a noble connection with the absolute centre and, at the same time, our previous commitments are all finished. It is an inner awakenment of life that brings divine knowledge. That wealth is there within us, but it is suppressed.

When we are in a foreign land we may seek the comforts which are supplied in hotels, but when we reach home, the hotel comforts are discarded; we find no more use for them. Sometimes a minor is kidnapped from home. Later, while visiting his native place he may stay in a hotel, but if he suddenly finds his father’s house and returns home, his parents will recognise him and say, “O, my son! You were stolen from us when you were young. We recognise your face. I am your mother, this is your father, here is your sister.” Then the hotel is no longer needed. In a similar way, with the inner awakenment of the soul, when we return back home, back to Godhead, we will find our comfortable home with Kṛṣṇa.

It is said <span class=\\"e3\\">Āchāryaṁ Māṁ vijānīyān</span>, the Spiritual Master is not to be differentiated. One thing is coming down from the Supreme Lord, so the oneness of continuity is not to be ignored. Guru can be here; Guru can be in another body also. The same teacher may come in a different body to inspire us; he may come to give us new hope and higher education. The substance should always be given a higher value than the form."},{"class":"b44","text":" First understand the degree of purity in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The followers of form are only imitationists; they want only to exploit Mahāprabhu and not to serve Him. They are our worst enemies. They are traitors; they have taken the garb of Mahāprabhu’s sampradāya, and they are saying something bogus. This is cheap marketing; they are extensively selling adulterated things very cheaply. They have no inner necessity to attain the purest thing (<span class=\\"e3\\">pūjala rāga-patha gaurava-bhaṅge</span>). Although he was such an exalted Vaiṣṇava, our Guru Mahārāj never presented himself as a great devotee. He always used to say, “I am a servant of the servant of the Vaiṣṇavas.” That was his claim. And he would say, “The higher devotees are my Guru. They are so exalted.” First come and practise all these things, and then you can hope to reach the goal. It is not so easy, or so cheap. “Out of many liberated persons, a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa is extremely rare” (<span class=\\"e3\\">koṭi-mukta-madhye ‘durlabha’ eka Kṛṣṇa-bhakta</span>)."},{"class":"b52","text":" Kṛṣṇa consciousness is an internal thing, and those who cannot see the internal truth will make much of the external cover. We do not support that. Rather we are interested in the real spirit. All the opposing elements who are interested in externals cannot touch us. Dogs may bark, but the barking of a dog has no importance. Because they make so much of the outer thing, they have no real purification of the heart to accept the pure thing, to discriminate what is purity, or what is love of Godhead, prema, after which even Brahmā and Mahādev aspire."}]},{"title":"The Original Guru","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b47","text":" The Original Guru"},{"class":"b43","text":" The original Spiritual Master is Nityānanda Prabhu. He is the general representation of Guru. In the spiritual world, He is the Guru-tattva principle in the four primary mellows of devotion, excluding the conjugal mellow. In madhura-rasa, Baladev’s representation is Anaṅgā Mañjarī, the sister of Rādhārāṇī."},{"class":"b44","text":" The position of Nityānanda is greater than that of Baladev. Why? He is distributing prema, divine love. And what is prema? It is higher than all other achievements. If one can give divine love, then all others must be subordinate to him. If Kṛṣṇa is subordinate to Mahāprabhu then, of course, Balarām is subordinate to Nityānanda. They are similar, but when magnanimity is added, Balarām becomes Nityānanda. That Balarām who can distribute divine love, who can perform that higher function, has come here as Nityānanda. Our foundation must be solid and proper. Then the structure should be erected. Otherwise the whole thing will go down (<span class=\\"e3\\">heno Nitāi vine bhāi Rādhā Kṛṣṇa pāite nāi</span>). We can get a solid foundation from Nityānanda Prabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" One day Nityānanda Prabhu came to Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s house in Mayapur. Mahāprabhu’s mother, Śachī Devī, and Viṣṇu Priyā Devī, His wife, were also there, as well as other devotees. Suddenly Nityānanda arrived, quite naked."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu managed to give Him some cloth. And perhaps He was concerned that the devotees might have some misconception about Nityānanda Prabhu. So, to prevent this He asked Nityānanda Prabhu for His kaupīn, His loincloth. He tore it up and distributed it amongst the householders that were present, instructing them, “Keep a piece of His loincloth as a kavacha, an amulet, and tie that with a thread to your arm or wear it around your neck. Please keep it with you. Then you will be able to achieve sense control very soon.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Nityānanda Prabhu has control of His senses to the extreme degree; He does not know anything of this world. His vairāgya, indifference to the world of mundane transaction, is of such a degree that He can appear naked amongst both male and female. So, the grace of Nityānanda Prabhu will construct a firm foundation for us. If there is a firm foundation, then we may build a great structure over it. If we have faith in Nityānanda, then that faith can bear any amount of weight. It won’t betray us."},{"class":"b51","text":" So, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Prabhupād has laid stress amongst the Westerners on devotion to Nityānanda. First, we must get His mercy. And then, afterwards, we can get the mercy of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu means Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa: <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa nahe anya</span>.

Nityānanda is very much kind to one who has some special tendency towards Gaura-līlā."},{"class":"b70","text":" “Take the Name of Gaurāṅga”"},{"class":"b43","text":" Nityānanda Prabhu walked from door to door in Bengal, saying, “Take the Name of Gaurāṅga! I’ll become your servant. You can purchase Me if you only take the Name of Gaurāṅga. I’ll be sold to you without any price or condition.” That was His temperament. When Mahāprabhu was in Purī, He sent Nityānanda Prabhu to Bengal. At that time He said, “Without You I don’t find anyone who can spread the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa, or devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, in Bengal. They are more engaged in the tantric method and smṛti. They make too much of these trifling things. They are puffed up, thinking that they have finished all knowledge. So, Bengal is a very hard field for preaching. Without You, no one will be able to awaken the masses. Separate Yourself from the higher castes and approach the masses with the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa. You are the fittest person for this work.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Nityānanda Prabhu went to Bengal, but without trying to preach the glories of the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa, Nityānanda began to preach the Name of Gaurāṅga. Nityānanda Prabhu found that there is some danger of thinking that Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes are very much akin to the mundane debauchery, lying, and stealing of a degraded soul. Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes are of a highly confidential nature. It is very difficult for the masses to understand the purity of Kṛṣṇa-līlā. The mass mind cannot accept Kṛṣṇa-līlā as the highest attainment. So, Nityānanda Prabhu found it would be difficult to preach Kṛṣṇa-līlā, but He found it would be easy to preach Gaura-līlā, where Kṛṣṇa has come to distribute Himself to the public with so much capital in His mind. Gaurāṅga means a dynamo which wants to distribute Kṛṣṇa surcharged with the most magnanimous, intensified pity and kindness for the ordinary people, with the greatest affection even for the criminals. Nityānanda Prabhu wanted to bring them in connection with Gaurāṅga, for then Kṛṣṇa-līlā would automatically be within their fist. So, He began to preach about Gaurāṅga, not Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, as commanded by Mahāprabhu. So, Nityānanda Prabhu says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Bhaja Gaurāṅga kaha Gaurāṅga, laha Gaurāṅgera Nāma</span>: worship Gaurāṅga, speak only of Gaurāṅga, and chant the Name of Gaurāṅga.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" There is another instance of the relationship between Kṛṣṇa and Balarām, and Gaurāṅga and Nityānanda, which is described in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Chaitanya-bhāgavat</span>. Śachī Devī had a dream that Kṛṣṇa and Balarām were sitting on a throne, and Nityānanda was fighting with Balarām, “Come down from the throne. It is no longer Dvāpar-yuga. The Age of Kali has come, and My master Gaurāṅga must occupy Your position on this throne. You come down!” Balarām began giving some opposition. “No, no, why should We come down? We have been sitting on this throne for such a long time.” Nityānanda Prabhu began forcibly taking Him down, and Balarām submitted slightly. Nityānanda Prabhu said, “My master Gaurāṅga wants to take the position now. The age for Him has come.” So Nityānanda is very partial to Gaurāṅga. He says, “Kṛṣṇa is far off. My Lord is Gaurāṅga.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" So, we must be very grateful to Nityānanda Prabhu, for He is our Guru. And Guru’s grace is so important that Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī says, “O, Rādhārāṇī, I want Your grace. Without You, I don’t want Kṛṣṇa separately. I never want Kṛṣṇa without You.” That should be the healthy attitude of a devotee. This has been explained by Śrīla Viśvanāth Chakravartī Ṭhākur in his <span class=\\"e3\\">Gurvāṣṭakam</span>:"},{"class":"b60","text":" yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo<br />yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto ’pi<br />dhyāyaṁ stuvaṁs tasya yaśas tri-sandhyaṁ<br />vande guroḥ śrī-charaṇāravindam"},{"class":"b43","text":" “I bow down to the lotus feet of Śrī Gurudev.

Therefore, we should always meditate on Śrī Gurudev, and pray for his mercy.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" This is the position of Śrī Guru, by whose grace we can get everything, we can get the grace of Kṛṣṇa, and without whose grace, we have no other prospect. So, in this way, we must have reverence for he who has given us our first connection with Kṛṣṇa consciousness."},{"class":"b70","text":" Guru is not a doll"},{"class":"b43","text":" But at the same time, as we offer reverence to Gurudev, we must not conceive that the Guru is a doll, a lifeless figure. Because we are familiar with a particular figure and accept that as our Guru we should not become misled. The important thing is what he says, his instructions. That is attracting our inner hearts. I am not this body. I am the enquirer. That thing which is satisfying me, drawing the enquirer to the enquired—I must try to locate that thing in him. I must not rely on material calculation. I am not this body. Who am I, the disciple? Am I only this body, this figure, this colour, this caste? Or am I this temperament, this scholarship and intellectualism? No. I am he who has come to seek. Who is the party within me, and who is the party in Guru? We must be fully awake to that. What is the inner thing? I have come for that. We must be awake to our own interest."},{"class":"b69","text":" There is the relative principle and the absolute principle. We shall have to eliminate the form, ignore the form; we shall always have to keep the spirit. Otherwise, we become form worshippers, idol worshippers."},{"class":"b70","text":" Guru: more than meets the eye"},{"class":"b43","text":" It is said, of course, that the connection with the Spiritual Master is eternal (<span class=\\"e3\\">chakṣu-dāna dila yei, janme janme Prabhu sei</span>). But we must not identify our Guru with the appearance we perceive with our physical senses. Our inner identification of him will be clarified according to the growth of our vision. When our vision increases and takes shape from material to transcendental, his look will also change accordingly."},{"class":"b44","text":" A man is sometimes known, most externally, by his uniform, and then by his body, then by his mind, then by his intelligence. As much as our eye will develop to see things rightly, what we are seeing will also change its face. Kṛṣṇa says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Āchāryaṁ Māṁ vijānīyān</span>: ultimately it is I who am the Āchārya.” It is the function of divinity, and in different stages there may be different forms. Different Āchāryas may work at the same time."},{"class":"b44","text":" The knowledge, the ideal, is growing from subtle to gross. And the depth of the vision of the eye will disclose the different figures of the different Āchāryas. It will go in different rasas to the highest position, by a gradual process of realisation. Otherwise our knowledge will be based on the material conception. And to force the material conception onto divinity is a crime, it is ignorance, it is erroneous."},{"class":"b44","text":" We have to free ourselves from the snare of identifying reality with the physical form presented to our senses. The eyes deceive us; they cannot give us the proper form or colour. The ears cannot give us the proper sound. The concrete reality is beyond the experience of our senses. So then, what is that thing? Because we are in such a low position, we can gradually go there to the inner world only with the help of our Guru."},{"class":"b44","text":" But how can we recognise our Guru? Sometimes in the winter he wears a particular dress, and in the summer he wears another dress. If we attach so much importance to the external dress, then what should we do? Should we think that the dress is indispensable to the body? The Guru may come to us in a particular body. Suppose the Guru appears as a young man. When he has become an old man, and the young form has grown into another form, how are we to recognise him? How are we to differentiate? Again, in one birth he may have come in a particular body, and another time he may appear in a different body. The same Guru may appear differently at different times. How are we to recognise him? From the external consideration we must go to the internal."},{"class":"b44","text":" If I am devoid of flesh and blood and I exist only in a subtle body, then I shall also find my Guru there, in a subtle body. The demigods, Gandharvas, and siddhas, the perfected beings in the heavenly planets, also have their gurus, but they do not have a material body, nor does their guru have a material body."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, by eliminating the external conception we have to enter into the internal, and that will be all-important to a progressive disciple. That does not mean that one should disregard the physical form of our guru. But the real importance is within. We must worship the remnants of the Guru: his coat, his boot, his sandal. But that does not mean that his shoe is superior to his body; we must serve his person. In a similar way, if we are eager to do some physical service for him, if we want to massage his feet, but he does not desire that and says, “No, no, no”, then should we do that? Our internal obedience to him will be higher. In this way we have to make progress from the gross to the subtle."},{"class":"b69","text":" Who is Guru? Where is he to be located? What is his ideal? What does he really want me to do? These things must not be dismissed from our ears. We must not give only formal adherence. We want the spiritual way. The spiritual man is going to the spiritual world to have the spiritual realisation. It is all a spiritual transaction. And all conceptions of mundane, whether physical, mental, or intellectual, should be eliminated in our journey if we want to go to the inner world of substance."},{"class":"b70","text":" Progress: elimination and acceptance"},{"class":"b43","text":" This attitude will decide our real progress, our real design of life. Our fulfilment comes always from the inner side. If one can catch up that thread, then he can go and get things of that higher, spiritual quality. We may appreciate the beautiful figure, style, movement, and intellectual delivery of the Spiritual Master, and so many other things may be appreciable. But what should be the highest focal point of our realisation? What should be our highest aim, for which we will eliminate everything else?"},{"class":"b44","text":" Progress means elimination and acceptance. And our spiritual life must always be a dynamic thing; otherwise we shall be dead. Progress means acceptance and elimination. The scientists also say this in their theory of natural selection, “survival of the fittest”. Nature is selecting some and eliminating others. Life is dynamic; we are living in a dynamic world. Everywhere we find acceptance and elimination. That is progress. And our life must be progressive, not static."},{"class":"b44","text":" To get the grace of Nityānanda Prabhu, we should try as far as possible to study the character of Śrī Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu, to serve Him, to serve His Dhām, and His devotees. That will easily help us attain the grade of Nityānanda Prabhu. And there will always be so many practical dealings in our present stage, but we must always keep the highest ideal over our heads. With this ideal we shall be able to make progress. Our ideal, our highest model—that is our all-in-all in life. To be acquainted with the conception of the highest ideal and to be on the path of realisation of that goal is the greatest wealth in one’s life."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī prays, “I only aspire after one thing.

What we received from our Spiritual Master, in what way have we received it? Properly, or only showingly? The time has come to purify us, to test whether we are real students, real disciples, or his disciples only in face and confession. What is the position of a real disciple? If we live in the society, what is the depth of our creed? In what attitude have we accepted his teachings? How deep-rooted is it within us? The fire has come to test whether we can stand.

I am a servant of that clan, that sampradāya. Everyone may leave me, but I shall stand alone!” With this attitude we must march on, whatever the circumstances may be. Then the recognition may come in my favour, that “Yes, under such trying circumstances he is still there.” Our superiors will be pleased with us."},{"class":"b69","text":" We must analyse ourselves.

One whose reliance, regard, and faith is in the śāstra, who attentively observes all the rules and regulations and practices that are found in the scriptures, and whose practices and social activities are coloured by his faith in God is an intermediate devotee. And one who acts according to his faith in Kṛṣṇa in every stage, whatever circumstances there may be, is a first-class devotee. His faith in Kṛṣṇa is his main guidance. In whatever circumstances he may be in—with body, mind, and soul; in thought, word, and deed; in every way—he does everything for the service of Kṛṣṇa. He is the topmost devotee of Kṛṣṇa.

We can’t go to hell.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Frustrated, Nārad returned to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa said, “Oh, I am suffering very severely now.

He needs feet dust? Please take our feet dust and go immediately.” Nārad was astounded. “What is the matter?” he thought. “No devotees would offer Kṛṣṇa any dust from their feet, but these people are doing it.” He told them, “Do you know what is the consequence of your actions?” The gopīs replied “Yes. Eternal hell. We don’t care for that! If slight relief is there for our Lord, that is our only concern.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" This is one point that came to my mind at that time. And another was this: Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Āmāra ājñāya Guru hañā tāra’ ei deśa</span>: on My order, become Guru and deliver the land.” So, we should think, “I am fallible, but I am confident that what my Guru has given to me is an uncommon, vital, and nectarean thing. And he has asked me to give it to others. It does not matter. I shall take the risk. He has ordered me. I am his servant. He will look after me.” With this spirit of risk, the disciple will approach the responsibility thinking, “I may go to hell, but I must carry out the order of my Gurudev. I may die, but I must carry out the order of my commander.” With this spirit he is to approach the task, and there will be no danger if this consciousness is maintained; but if he deviates from that connection and goes self-seeking for a mundane purpose, he’ll be doomed.

It had already been announced to the public that Rāmānuja was receiving that mantra, and so many people were standing outside waiting.

Don’t you know what is the result?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “Yes, I know: eternal hell, but your mantra cannot but be fruitful, so they will be saved, although I may go to hell.” If you can take this sort of risk, your Guru will bless you, and you cannot be doomed. This sort of risk should be taken by the disciple and only on the force, on the basis, of that spiritual inspiration. If he does so, he can never be doomed. The eye of the Lord is there. God is there. Guru is there. He cannot but be saved. They cannot leave him in danger and relish thinking, “The person who is carrying out our orders is going to hell.” Can they tolerate such a thing? Are our guardians living or are they dead?"},{"class":"b44","text":" We must be so much selfless that we can think, “I may go to hell, but I must carry out my Guru’s order. So, through me, the work may go on.” This sort of conviction in the process, in the mantra, gives us the strength to carry out the work of Āchārya. If I think, “This medicine is helping me; I am in the curing process, and this medicine is helping me”, then, if I see a similar case, I may hand the medicine over to him."},{"class":"b44","text":" Jīva Goswāmī says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Jñāna śāṭhya vitta śāṭhya</span>: if I have some money and another person is suffering with no money, if I keep tight my money, and he lies fasting without food, then I’ll be responsible for his suffering.” So, if I have some knowledge, if I can help my neighbour, but don’t do that, I’ll be responsible.

You have meagre knowledge. You don’t know his body fully. You treat him, and you are wrong.” The doctor submitted to me.

It is not possible."},{"class":"b69","text":" In good faith, with whatever knowledge we have, we must sincerely help others. In that spirit one may take up the work of Āchārya; otherwise he will be blamed. But we must be careful that whenever a Guru of superior quality is there, we must help others to accept him. We must not be a trespasser. It is also mentioned in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa</span> that when a greater person is available, those of a lower type should not venture to make disciples. Suppose a farmer has fertile land and two kinds of seed. The good seed should be planted first. If the better seed is not available, then ordinary seeds may be sown. For the sake of the harvest, the better seed should be given the first chance. If we are detached, if we are pure in heart, and if we are selfless, the better seed should always be sown first. The lower kind of seed should be withdrawn.

It is His flow. Chaitanya Mahāprabhu says, “Sanātan, Kṛṣṇa’s grace is flowing through Me to you; it is passing through Me, but I don’t understand all these words.” I feel something like that. I am carrying out my Āchārya’s order. Being so low, still I have accepted this duty as I have been ordered by my Āchārya to do. With this necessity within, one may do the work of an Āchārya."},{"class":"b69","text":" It is not only external, but internal also. The Āchārya has asked us, “Go on with the preaching; you are qualified. If you don’t do so, then why did I give it to you?

If we do not serve society with whatever we have imbibed from him, then we will be responsible to our Guru. He will chastise us saying, “You have taken so much energy from me, and now you are keeping it within you? You must let this loose to help others.” If one gets this sort of inspiration, he should try to fulfil the order, but still, difficulty is there. To become a guru, to capture the position of a guru, the respect of guru, that is one thing; to discharge the duty is another. Sincerity is necessary. This is of course difficult. There is no doubt that it is difficult; if one is unsuccessful, he will be lost, and others will also be lost. In the name of helping others he will deceive others, if he himself is full of deceit.

Still, he must be careful not to become mad with authority. Authority is a part of pratiṣṭhā, name and fame. There is also another tendency. When a guru comes in connection with vātsalya-rasa, the mood of guardianship over his disciples, his friendly relation with the godbrothers decreases, some special discrimination arises, and stealthily he is drawn to his disciples, indifferently neglecting his connection with his godbrothers. This tendency is sure to come, and it is difficult to keep up the balance. So, the brothers are neglected, and the sons get more attention. In this way the guru becomes partial. When he comes in close connection with his disciples, he has freedom; he is given an opportunity of absolute mastership. In that position it is very difficult to keep up his purity because of that temptation; there is the possibility of going down from the plane of Āchārya."},{"class":"b70","text":" Guru is all-in-all"},{"class":"b43","text":" Autocracy and democracy do not go well together.

This is where the Kṛṣṇa conception of Godhead comes to our relief. He whom we think to be supreme-most—Kṛṣṇa—Yaśodā is whipping Him. He is carrying Nanda’s shoes on his head, and He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this way we can adjust everything. Both the absolute faith and the relative position of the non-absolute—these two things should be harmonised."},{"class":"b44","text":" The guru should be recognised by impartial judgment. Everyone thinks that his own mother is the most affectionate. But when a comparison is drawn between two mothers to see who is more affectionate, an impartial criterion will be applied.

It is very difficult to bring an Āchārya under rule. You see, that is our practical experience. You please hear and note this. The position of Āchārya is a relative thing, and the position of the disciple is also relative, just like the relationship between mother and child, father and son, wife and husband. Although to his godbrothers a Guru will be seen in a relative position to his disciple, the Guru is absolute. So to adjust between the relative and absolute is a difficult thing; it is an eternal problem.

Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī says that vaidhī-bhakti, devotion under the guidance of śāstra, or laws and rules, is helpful only to a certain extent. It will help the inner awakening of love and affection and then retire. Law will retire, giving room to the spontaneous flow of love. Law is necessary, especially in the lower stages, but it should make room for free movement in the relationship. Freedom is the highest thing. Free service is rāga-marga, and that is service proper, not service that is regulated and coerced and pressed by law. That is not service. Our aim is Vṛndāvan. So, we want free service. Without freedom, service is not valuable. Forced labour is no labour; a labour of love is required. And that is the thing for which all are out. Let us essentially think that we are all out not only for the constitution, but the thing for which the constitution has been made; we are out for that high object of life: divine love. The constitution should promote that aim. With this feeling we should go on.

That sort of creeper should be planted in the garden of the heart and watered and nourished. The very characteristic of faith must not be lost by infringement, by over-pressure of the laws and rules. The free flow of the heart must be kept. The movement of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu is more of heart than of intellect. We should always consider this. The intellect must not check the free flow of the heart. We must always remember that. Free love and free faith are the only things, the most valuable things, for which we have come out of our own house and joined the Mission. This purity of purpose should always be kept intact. Of course, some help from law and regulation is necessary, but not so much as to check the growth of our vitality. We must promote vitality. The real spirit, the real purpose of the Mission should be given first hand. And lenient dealings are necessary amongst you. It is said, “If the tongue is cut by the tooth, should I pull out the tooth?” You are one organic whole; your dealings should not be such that the forgiveness of love is forgotten. The giving of love will conquer more than the giving of law.

Partiality means full freedom with his disciples. This relationship is also more attractive to him. The second danger is deviation. So, deviation and partiality—these two things can take down the Āchārya. These are the two enemies of an Āchārya. And one who takes that position must be particularly careful about these things. The position of an Āchārya is dangerous. It is full of temptations. Therefore, a strong, sincere, indomitable desire for the upper aspirations of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the indispensable necessity in an Āchārya. Otherwise, he can’t maintain his position. He will go down. He has become master and will think, “I am the master of all I survey.” In a particular circle, he is monarch. And monarchy can bring madness. That is a great temptation. If one is not sufficiently conscious of this fact, he will not be able to maintain his position. For one who has monarchy over men and money, it is very difficult to maintain a position as a servitor. The ego of mastership which is generally found within all of us comes to attack the guru. After all, we are wandering in the land of exploitation. Therefore, we should be very wakeful and scrutinising in our self-analysis. The general symptom of health is that the more one will go up, the more he will think, “I am going down.” This indirect method of measurement may be applied to measure our internal advancement. Externally one may maintain a superior position, but internally he should always be thinking, “O my Lord! I am in want. Give more grace to me! I can’t maintain my position.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" Money, women, and fame"},{"class":"b43","text":" It is a great misfortune if a Vaiṣṇava guru strays from the line. It is rare, but occasionally it may be found. Generally the symptoms of deviation fall into three different classes: kanak, kāminī, and pratiṣṭhā: money, women, and reputation. First, the guru loses his attraction for his own guru and śāstra-upadeś, the advice of the śāstra. Then, what he previously expressed, quoting the scriptures and the words of his own guru, gradually becomes absent in him. His attraction for the higher thing fades. That is pratiṣṭhā, prestige. Kanak, kāminī, pratiṣṭhā: money, women, and name and fame—these are the three tests to be put everywhere to see whether one is a sādhu or not, or what degree of sādhu he is. The first thing is deviation from his higher gurus. That should be detected. That is pratiṣṭhā, pride."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, he will show more tendency to amass money and not to spend it. Money may be collected, but that must be distributed for the service of the sampradāya, for the service of the Vaiṣṇavas. But amassing money—this is the second sign of deviation. The third is attraction towards the ladies. Of course, he may come in connection with money and women and also with the honour from his disciples. That is also necessary, but only for the purpose of the divine object, divine aim, not for himself. But if we can detect that he is utilising all these things for his personal interest and not for the cause of the sampradāya, then we should be careful."},{"class":"b69","text":" In the beginning, we may neglect some occasional problems; some instances of these kinds of deviations may be ignored. But if we find that they are becoming more prevalent, then we must inspect the situation carefully. And we are to bring it to persons similar to my position. And after consultation, we can take the matter to higher sources and consult other Āchāryas who are reliable. When we find that what appeared to us first in a small way is real, injurious, and of a big magnitude, and that our Spiritual Master is going down, then we must act to save ourselves. We must try to take steps which may save us from that epidemic contamination. We must try to save ourselves. And we must also try to save others who might fall prey to the same exploitation as us. That must be done in all sincerity. There is the possibility; it is mentioned in the śāstras and so many practical examples are also there.

The son may be the judge, and the father may be the lawyer, but the father must give respect to the son. He must give respect to the chair. So that kind of adjustment should be kept in the Mission. When you are alone, the Āchārya brother and his non-Āchārya brother can mix freely. You can give a slap to his face. But when publicly amongst his disciples, you must show that sort of behaviour.

And he loves the dog only because it is his master’s dog; not that he wants to take away the dog for himself. He loves it not with the idea of independent love for the dog, but because it is the master’s dog."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is a higher test of our love than simply to love the master. This will test whether we are really lovers. Kṛṣṇa is more pleased if He sees that His servant is being served. Why? Because His servant always serves Him, but he won’t take anything in return from Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa tries to give His devotees something, but they won’t take it. They have no aspiration to fulfil, no petition to enter in the course of their service. They want only cent per cent service. There is no possibility for Kṛṣṇa to award any remuneration there; He can’t find the slightest hole in their devotional service through which some remuneration can be pushed. His devotees are wholesale servants, and nothing but."},{"class":"b51","text":" Kṛṣṇa tries His best to give something to His devotees in return for their service, but He fails. So, when Kṛṣṇa sees that His desired aim of rewarding His servants is being done by someone else, He becomes indebted to that person thinking, “What I wanted to do for My servant, he is doing. I wanted to do that, but failed; it was not accepted. But now someone else is doing the same thing I wanted to do.” Kṛṣṇa is more favourable to the devotee who serves His servant. Then Kṛṣṇa comes to serve him. That is the underlying purpose of His saying “Those who are devotees of My devotee, they are the real devotees of My heart.” So bhakta-pūjā, worship of the devotees, is the best kind of worship. This statement is confirmed in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, in the Vedas, and by Vṛndāvan Dās Ṭhākur in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Chaitanya-bhāgavat</span>:"},{"class":"b60","text":" āmāra bhaktera-pūjā—āmā haite baḍa"},{"class":"b43","text":" Bhakta-pūjā, worship of the devotees, is advocated everywhere.

He said, “We are śuddha-śākta, worshippers of the pure potency, not the mundane potency.” We worship the potency who is wholesale dedicated to the potent without retaining Her individual independence as a separate entity at all, who is cent per cent dependent on Kṛṣṇa. Such a potency as this is very, very rarely to be conceived."},{"class":"b69","text":" The direct approach to Kṛṣṇa is improper.

He cannot but praise those devotees and revere them for their magnanimity. It is only by their help that we can get the nearness of Kṛṣṇa. Should we think it possible that one can take a jump across the whole system and approach the king? It is unreal."},{"class":"b69","text":" Someone may be externally engaged in such a way that apparently he is a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa, but if he eliminates the devotees, that devotion has not taken real shape; it is a vague thing. He is far away from Kṛṣṇa. Suppose we take as an example the highest peak in the Himalayas, Mount Everest. We can see Mount Everest from far off. But to approach Mount Everest, we must pass through so many closer mountain peaks. When our approach to Mount Everest is genuine, we cannot avoid discovering the name and characteristic of other peaks surrounding Mount Everest. But from far off we can see only Mount Everest and not the other peaks surrounding it. So, when we say that our connection is with Kṛṣṇa alone, then we are far off. If we are to actually approach the king, we must approach him through his entourage. If we are actually to approach Everest, we cannot but have a connection with the nearer peaks surrounding that highest peak.

That is a vague kind of devotion. It has not taken any particular shape because he is ignoring the āśraya, the shelter-giving devotees in the positions surrounding the Lord.

Generally they think, “We want liberation, not the service of Kṛṣṇa. To earn liberation, we are accepting the devotion of Kṛṣṇa.” That is a lower form of worship—worldly worship—not real worship in the transcendental plane. That is not eternal, but temporary. Devotion to the Lord must not be subservient to any other aim of life. The desire for liberation is one criterion of an imitation devotee, and another criterion is the neglect of elevated devotees. When the Lord alone is being worshipped, that is also false. These two kinds of apparent devotional practices which are generally seen in the world may be dismissed.

These two kinds of devotees are classified as viviktānandī and goṣṭhyānandī. The goṣṭhyānandīs, by nature, love preaching. They live amongst the Vaiṣṇavas. But there is another group, the viviktānandī, who prefer a solitary position. There they chant the Holy Name of the Lord, or think about the Lord’s Pastimes (līlā). These two groups have both been mentioned as being situated on a high platform of devotional service, just before the stage of pure love of Godhead. When they have completely attained the highest stage, there is no qualitative difference between one and the other: they are one and the same.

Therefore it cannot be said that one who does not have the preaching tendency is a lower Vaiṣṇava."},{"class":"b44","text":" Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur has clearly grouped these two sections of devotees in the stage of those who are just about to occupy the highest plane.

According to the desire of Kṛṣṇa, they will do His will. The devotee whom Kṛṣṇa wants to preach will do that work, but those who do not like to work in that way cannot be called unqualified. Those that like preaching will naturally speak in favour of the preaching camp. Because they are inspired by Kṛṣṇa to do that service, they are successful. Kṛṣṇa says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Āchāryam Māṁ vijānīyān</span>: it is My inspiration that can really deliver the fallen souls.” Whomever Kṛṣṇa will accept can understand Him—others cannot (<span class=\\"e3\\">yam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas</span>).

Why? Because it is spacious and broad; it is available to everyone. And in Gaura-līlā, Kṛṣṇa is distributing Himself to the fallen.” This is something in addition to Kṛṣṇa-līlā. Then, whenever we find that good fortune has made someone an agent to raise up the fallen souls, we may have some greater appreciation for him. Some justification for considering the preachers to be more fortunate may come if we consider that Kṛṣṇa is better when preaching than when playing within His own group."},{"class":"b44","text":" Naturally we will have preference for the preachers who have brought Kṛṣṇa consciousness here amongst us. Kṛṣṇa has chosen certain devotees as His agents to preach about Him to the fallen souls. And that is more desirable for us, in our present position. So, if we develop our perspective in that line, of course we can say that fallen souls like us will give more stress to those who are the cause for our delivery. To think that some agents are preferable to others because the symptom of magnanimity is more easily traceable in them is a relative view in the ultimate context of reality."},{"class":"b69","text":" Although sometimes we may judge Vaiṣṇavas according to their different activities, we are not always correct, because a devotee is chosen for a particular service by the Lord, and whatever the Lord wants to do through him is done by His will. This is the underlying principle: it is His selection. Sometimes the selection comes to A, sometimes to B, and sometimes to C. We are all at the disposal of the Lord’s infinite will, and according to His sweet will, according to how Kṛṣṇa wants to utilise us, our activities will be successful. That is the absolute consideration. We cannot fail to connect success with the medium; there is also some value in that, but we must consider that Kṛṣṇa is there in the background. We must always understand that the divine will, the highest will, is working through us. So we should not be extreme in judging a devotee according to external considerations."},{"class":"b70","text":" Bābājīs and preachers"},{"class":"b43","text":" Gaura Kiśor Dās Bābājī Mahārāj did not preach, but his disciple, our Spiritual Master, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur Prabhupād, preached with great magnitude. Śrīla Lokanāth Goswāmī did not preach at all, but we find that the preaching of his only disciple, Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur, was most extensive. So a Vaiṣṇava should not be judged only by the amount of work that he shows outwardly. His success is at the disposal of the divine will. Kṛṣṇa awards service to a particular person according to His own choice, and enables that person to carry out that service. There are many examples of this."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu preached throughout the length and breadth of Bengal with great force, but Śrīla Gadādhar Paṇḍit, although apparently not doing any tangible service in the līlā of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, is said to be Rādhārāṇī’s bhāva, transcendental sentiments, incarnate.

Where should I take refuge without such a Lord?” With this on his lips, he was rolling on the floor in ecstasy."},{"class":"b44","text":" After a long time, he gradually subsided, and Gadādhar thought to himself, “What did I think about this great personality?

What intense love he has for Kṛṣṇa!” Then he thought, “I have committed Vaiṣṇava-aparādh, an offence to a great devotee. How can I free myself? I thought ill of him. What is the remedy for that offence?” So, he thought to himself and then told Mukunda, “I have committed an offence against this great mahātmā. How can I get out of that? I am thinking that generally those who come to this devotional line have to formally accept some preceptor, but I have not yet taken initiation from any Vaiṣṇava. If I take initiation from him, he will forgive me and my offences. He won’t take any offence from me if I surrender unto his holy feet. Then only can I get release from this crime. But I have to consult my Master Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu. So, he went to consult with Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" Sometime before this, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu was seen calling the name of Puṇḍarīk and crying, “Puṇḍarīk, My father! Puṇḍarīk! Where are you?” In this way He was suddenly crying. Ordinary people could not understand. They began to ask, “Who is that Puṇḍarīk? For whom is the Lord wailing so much? Why is Nimāi Paṇḍit wailing ‘Puṇḍarīk! Puṇḍarīk!’?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Within a few days, Puṇḍarīk came from another village to his Nabadwīp house. Mukunda Datta was his co-villager, so he knew Puṇḍarīk. When the devotees enquired, “Who is this Puṇḍarīk?” Mukunda Datta answered, “Puṇḍarīk has got a small estate; he is a well-to-do, married man.” So, Gadādhar Paṇḍit asked Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu about Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi, saying, “I have committed an offence against the great Vaiṣṇava, Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi, so for my own spiritual good I feel the necessity to take initiation from him. But without consulting You, and getting Your consent, I can’t do anything. I put it before You.

Disappointed, He left the circle of the Rāsa dance and went to search after Her."},{"class":"b51","text":" Although the parakīya-madhura-rasa, the highest mellow of conjugal love, Vṛndāvan, and the gopīs were all there, still there is a categorical difference in quality between the other gopīs and the particular camp of Rādhārāṇī. In every way there is a categorical difference, both in quality and quantity. Jayadev Goswāmī, in his <span class=\\"e3\\">Gītā-govinda</span> (3.1) has described how Kṛṣṇa left the circle of the Rāsa dance:"},{"class":"b60","text":" kaṁsārir api saṁsāra-vāsanābaddha-śṛṅkhalām<br />rādhām ādhāya hṛdaye tatyāja vraja-sundarīḥ"},{"class":"b43","text":" “Lord Kṛṣṇa took Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī within His heart, for He wanted to dance with Her. In this way, He left the arena of the Rāsa dance and the company of all the other beautiful damsels of Vraja.” Jayadev has described in this way that Kṛṣṇa left the circle of the Rāsa dance, taking Rādhā within His heart. Kṛṣṇa departed in search of Rādhārāṇī. Her position is so exalted. It is said, “Lord Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental desires for loving exchanges could not be satisfied even in the midst of billions of gopīs. Thus He went searching after Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Just imagine how transcendentally qualified She is! (<span class=\\"e3\\">Śata-koṭi-gopīte nahe kāma-nirvāpaṇa</span>).”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The other gopīs numbered so many, but in quality they were a little less. Their total combination could not satisfy Kṛṣṇa. The qualitative difference was there. That is found."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Rūpānuga sampradāya, the followers of the line of Śrī Rūpa, are those who have the unique taste of service in the camp of Rādhārāṇī. In that plane, there is no entrance of any mundane exploitation or renunciation, and not even legalised śāstric devotion. The highest kind of devotion is not controlled by any law. It is spontaneous and automatic. Sacrifice to the highest degree is only possible in that camp. The highest kind of divine sentiment is distributed from the camp of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, and that can never be compared with any attainment hitherto known even in the eternal factor of time and space."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, there is another stage for which we should be prepared. Why should we try to enter into the camp of Rādhārāṇī? Should we think that there, in that better atmosphere, we shall have Kṛṣṇa’s presence more confidentially? Should we think, “I will have contact with Kṛṣṇa very intimately?” Should we want to enter into that camp? No—we want to avoid the connection of Kṛṣṇa, but concentrate on the service of Rādhārāṇī. Why? What more benefit is possible there in the service of Rādhārāṇī? If we approach Kṛṣṇa directly to give service to Him, we shall be losers. Rādhārāṇī’s service to Kṛṣṇa is of the highest order in every way. If we devote our energy to help Rādhārāṇī, our energy will be utilised in Her service. In this way She will serve Kṛṣṇa with Her service more enhanced. Then the reciprocation will pass to us through Her as our reward. That will be devotion of the highest type, mahābhāva."},{"class":"b51","text":" So, the general inclination of the sakhīs, the confidential maidservants of Rādhārāṇī, is not to come in direct connection with Kṛṣṇa. They avoid that. But still, it is the benevolent and generous nature of Rādhārāṇī to connect them with Kṛṣṇa on some plea at some time or other. But their innate nature is always to avoid Kṛṣṇa and concentrate on the service of Rādhārāṇī. This is confirmed in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Chaitanya-charitāmṛta</span> (Madhya-līlā, 8.208):"},{"class":"b60","text":" rādhāra svarūpa—kṛṣṇa-prema kalpa-latā<br />sakhī-gaṇa haya tāra pallava-puṣpa-pātā"},{"class":"b43","text":" “By nature, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is just like a creeper of love of Godhead, and the gopīs are the twigs, flowers, and leaves of that creeper.” Eternally the twigs, flowers, and leaves sprout from the creeper of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. She is the trunk, and they are the branches. This is their relationship."},{"class":"b69","text":" Yet still, there is another, higher thing. We are known as Rūpānugas, or the followers of Śrī Rūpa. Why? The service of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī eliminates everything, even Nārāyaṇ, to go to Kṛṣṇa. There is the Kṛṣṇa of Dvārakā, the Kṛṣṇa of Mathurā, and the Kṛṣṇa of Vṛndāvan. Then again in Vṛndāvan, where there is free mixing without hesitation in other camps, Rādhārāṇī’s camp is the highest. Eliminating all other camps, direct service to Rādhārāṇī is considered to be the highest. Still, there is another point."},{"class":"b70","text":" Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī—Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī"},{"class":"b43","text":" Who is Rūpa? Rūpa Mañjarī. Generally the hierarchy in the spiritual world is eternal. New recruits can occupy a particular rank of mañjarī, assistant, in madhura-rasa. And the leader of the mañjarīs is Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī. What is the special feature in the mañjarī camp which is not found among the sakhīs, girlfriends of Kṛṣṇa? First there is Rādhārāṇī, then the camp of Her right-hand personal attendant, Lalitā. Then, under Lalitā, there is Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī. What is the unique position of the followers of Śrī Rūpa? The new recruits can attain to that status. Now, the privilege of this mañjarī class we are to conceive most respectfully and attentively."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Rādhā and Govinda are in secrecy, in a private place, the sakhīs, who are well-versed in the art of that kind of play because they are a little grown-up, do not like to approach there to disturb Their confidential mixing. If the more grown-up sakhīs enter there, both Rādhā and Govinda will feel shy. So their presence may create some disturbance. But the younger girls can enter there, and then Rādhā and Govinda have no hesitation in free mixing. So in that highest stage of the mixing of Rādhā-Govinda, the free play of Rādhā-Govinda, these mañjarīs, the younger girls, can have admission. But the grown-up sakhīs cannot have admission there."},{"class":"b44","text":" New recruits may come up to the mañjarī class. And the mañjarīs have that sort of special advantage under the leadership of Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī. So, they get the best advantage there; the most sacred type of pure service, which is not open even to the sakhīs, is open to the mañjarīs. That is found in Rādhārāṇī’s camp. So, the position of the Rūpānugas, the followers of Śrī Rūpa, is the most profitable position. That has been given out by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. That has been shown by Him, and that is fixed as the highest limit of our fortune in Kṛṣṇa’s concern. This is unexpectable, undesignable, and beyond hope, but our prospect lies there in that subtle camp of Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī, Rūpa Goswāmī."},{"class":"b69","text":" So, the camp, the sampradāya of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, is known as the Rūpānuga sampradāya. There our fate and our fortune are located. Now we have to conduct ourselves in such a way that naturally we can connect with that highest, purest spiritual conception from here. We must not allow ourselves to be satisfied with anything less than this highest ideal. That should be the highest goal of our life. And we must adjust our approach from our present position."},{"class":"b70","text":" Spiritual inheritance"},{"class":"b50","text":" We are minors. Our father has left us with so many important documents about the properties we are to inherit. As minors, we should try to find out what properties belong to us in those documents. When we come of age, then we shall take possession of our rightful inheritance. The rāgānuga-śāstra, the scriptures of spontaneous devotional love, has been given to us, left to us, by our Guru, our guardian, our father. And as we grow more and more in the spiritual line, we will have to detect what is our prospect, what is our real wealth. We must recover that. We must have that. It is there in the document. It is ours. This is our position. We are minors, but we must become majors and demand the service meant for us by our Guardians."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Devotee:</span> We are putting in our claim with you. We think that in the absence of our father, the court has appointed a guardian, in order to keep us out of mischief and also to regulate our inheritance."},{"class":"b71","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj:</span> This is not mine. This is the property of my Gurudev. And Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Prabhupād gave you a clue. He has distributed the key widely and given a clue: “With the key come and open the iron chest and find out what valuable ornaments and gems are within the chest.” Of course, no one will understand us when we say such things. Who will come to appreciate? They’ll say, “Oh, this is all the product of a disorganised brain. These people are trying to take electricity from the sky, leaving aside this concrete earth. They are like the chātak bird.” Rūpa Goswāmī says that there is a class of bird known as chātak, who never take a drop of water from the earth. Their nature is that whenever they want a drop of water, they always cast their eyes to the clouds. “One drop of pure water!”—that is their cry. And so they wait, with their beaks towards the sky, towards the clouds. And they never use any water from the earth. So, our line is like that. The spirit of that bird is described in the following way by Rūpa Goswāmī:"},{"class":"b70","text":" A drop of Your grace"},{"class":"b60","text":" virachaya mayi daṇḍaṁ dīnabandho dayāṁ vā<br />gatir iha na bhavattaḥ kāchid anyā mamāsti<br />nipatatu śata-koṭir nirbharaṁ vā navāmbhas<br />tad api kila payodaḥ stūyate chātakena"},{"class":"b43","text":" “You may punish me, O cloud, You may punish me. If a thunderbolt comes, I’ll be nowhere. You can throw down thunder, or You can give me water. But how much can I drink with my small beak? A flood of rain may come. O Lord of the poor, Lord of the helpless, You can give me a drop of Your devotion, or You may punish me like anything.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He is always praying for water. The cloud may satisfy him immediately or, by sending a thunderbolt, it may finish him and efface him from the earth. The bird has no other alternative by nature. So he says, “My position is also like that bird. O Kṛṣṇa, You may finish me, destroy me, efface me from the world, or You may save me by only a drop of Your grace. I won’t search after my satisfaction in the mud. That is finished. I will never go back to search for my fortune in the earth, in the mundane. I am already fixed to do or die. Either I must receive a drop of Your grace, or You may finish me.” In this way, Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī prays that Kṛṣṇa’s mercy will descend like rain from the clouds, and not only quench his thirst, but bathe him, satisfy his utmost hankering, and fulfil his innermost necessity."},{"class":"b52","text":" So, we should never search for our fortune in the mud.
