We are anxious to gather whatever information is contained in it, and with such acquirement, our curiosity stops. This mode of study prevails amongst a great number of readers, who are great men in their own estimation as well as in the estimation of those who are of their own stamp. In fact, most readers are mere repositories of facts and statements made by other people. But this is not study. The student is to read facts with a view to create and not with the object of fruitless retention. Students, like satellites, should reflect whatever light they receive from authors and not imprison facts and thoughts just as the magistrates imprison convicts in the jail. Thought is progressive. The author’s thought must have progress in the reader in the shape of correction or development. He is the best critic who can show the further development of an old thought, but a mere denouncer is the enemy of progress and consequently of nature. “Begin anew”, says the critic, “because the old masonry does not answer at present. Let the old author be buried because his time is gone.” These are shallow expressions. Progress certainly is the law of nature, and there must be corrections and developments with the progress of time. But progress means going further or rising higher. Now, if we are to follow our foolish critic, we are to go back to our former terminus and make a new race, and when we have run half the race, another critic of his stamp will cry out: “Begin anew, because the wrong road has been taken!” In this way our stupid critics will never allow us to go over the whole road and see what is in the other terminus. Thus the shallow critic and the fruitless reader are the two greatest enemies of progress. We must shun them."},{"class":"b44","text":" The true critic, on the other hand, advises us to preserve what we have already obtained, and to adjust our race from that point where we have arrived in the heat of our progress. He will never advise us to go back to the point whence we started, as he fully knows that in that case there will be a fruitless loss of our valuable time and labour. He will direct the adjustment of the angle of the race at the point where we are. This is also the characteristic of the useful student. He will read an old author and will find out his exact position in the progress of thought. He will never propose to burn the book on the ground that it contains thoughts which are useless. No thought is useless. Thoughts are means by which we attain our objects. The reader who denounces a bad thought does not know that a bad road is even capable of improvement and conversion into a good one. One thought is a road leading to another. Thus the reader will find that one thought which is the object today will be the means of a further object tomorrow. Thoughts will necessarily continue to be an endless series of means and objects in the progress of humanity. The great reformers will always assert that they have come out not to destroy the old law but to fulfill it. Vālmīki, Vyās, Plato<span class=\\"e8\\">1</span>, Jesus<span class=\\"e8\\">2</span>, Mohammed, Confucius, and Chaitanya Mahāprabhu assert the fact either expressly or by their conduct."},{"class":"b44","text":" The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>, like all religious works, philosophical performances, and writings of great men, has suffered from the imprudent conduct of useless readers and stupid critics. The former have done so much injury to the work that they have surpassed the latter in their evil consequence. Men of brilliant thoughts have passed by the work in quest of truth and philosophy, but the prejudice which they imbibed from its useless readers and their conduct prevented them from making a candid investigation. Not to say of other people, the great genius of Rājā Rām Mohan Rāy, the founder of the sect of Brahmoism, did not think it worth his while to study this ornament of the religious library. He crossed the gate of the Vedānta, as set up by the māyāvād construction of Śaṅkar Āchārya, the chosen enemy of the Jains, and preferred to chalk his way out to the Unitarian form of the Christian faith, converted into an Indian appearance."},{"class":"b44","text":" Rājā Rām Mohan Rāy was an able man. He could not be satisfied with the theory of illusion contained in the māyāvād philosophy of Śaṅkar. His heart was full of love for nature. He saw through the eye of his mind that he could not believe in his identity with God. He ran out from the bounds of Śaṅkar to those of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Koran</span>. There even he was not satisfied. He then studied the pre-eminently beautiful precepts and history of Jesus, first in the English translations and at last in the original Greek, and took shelter under the holy banners of the Jewish reformer. But Rām Mohan Rāy was also a patriot. He wanted to reform his country in the same way as he reformed himself. He knew it fully that truth does not belong exclusively to any individual man or to any nation or particular race. It belongs to God, and man, whether in the poles or on the equator, has a right to claim it as the property of his Father. On these grounds he claimed the truths inculcated by the Western saviour as also the property of himself and his countrymen, and thus he established the samāj of the Brāhmos independently of what was in his own country in the beautiful <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>.<span class=\\"e8\\">3</span> His noble deeds will certainly procure him a high position in the history of reformers. But then, to speak the truth, he would have done more if he had commenced his work of reformation from the point where the last reformer in India left it. It is not our business to go further on this subject. Suffice it to say that the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> did not attract the genius of Rām Mohan Rāy. His thought, mighty though it was, unfortunately branched like the Ranigunj line of the parent railway from the barren station of Śaṅkar Āchārya and did not attempt for an extension from the terminus station of the great <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> expounder of Nadia. We do not doubt that the progress of time will correct the error, and by a further extension the branch line will lose itself somewhere in the main line of progress. We expect such attempts in abler reformer of the followers of Rām Mohan Rāy."},{"class":"b44","text":" The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> has suffered alike from shallow critics both Indian and foreign. That book has been accursed and denounced by a great number of our young countrymen, who have scarcely read its contents and pondered over the philosophy on which it is founded. It is owing mostly to their imbibing an unfounded prejudice against it when they were in school. The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>, as a matter of course, has been held in derision by those teachers who are generally of an inferior mind and intellect. This prejudice is not easily shaken off when the student grows up unless he candidly studies the book and ruminates on the doctrines of Vaiṣṇavism. We are ourselves witnesses of the fact. When we were in college, reading the philosophical works of the West and exchanging thought with the thinkers of the day, we had contracted a hatred towards the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>. That great work looked like a repository of wicked and stupid ideas, scarcely adapted to the nineteenth century, and we hated to hear any arguments in its favor. With us then, a volume of Channing, Parker, Emerson, or Newman had more weight than the whole lot of the Vaiṣṇava works. Greedily, we poured over the various commentaries of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Holy Bible</span> and of the labours of the Tattva Bodhinī Sabhā containing extracts from the Upaniṣads and the Vedānta, but no work of the Vaiṣṇavas had any favor with us. But when we advanced in age and our religious sentiment received development, we turned out in a manner Unitarian in our belief and prayed as Jesus prayed in the garden. Accidentally, we fell in with a work about the great Chaitanya, and on reading it with some attention in order to settle the historical position of that mighty genius of Nadia, we had the opportunity of gathering His explanations of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> given to the wrangling Vedāntists of the Benares school. The accidental study created in us a love for all of the works which we find about our Eastern saviour. We gathered with difficulties the famous kaḍachās in Sanskrit, written by the disciples of Chaitanya. The explanations that we got of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> from these sources were of such a charming character that we procured a copy of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> complete and studied its texts (difficult of course to those who are not trained up in philosophical thoughts) with the assistance of the famous commentaries of Śrīdhar Swāmī. From such study it is that we have at last gathered the real doctrines of the Vaiṣṇavas. Oh! What a trouble to get rid of prejudices gathered in unripe years!"},{"class":"b44","text":" As far as we can understand, no enemy of Vaiṣṇavism will find any beauty in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>. The true critic is a generous judge, void of prejudices and party spirit. One who is at heart the follower of Mohammed will certainly find the doctrines of the New Testament to be a forgery by the fallen angel. A Trinitarian Christian, on the other hand, will denounce the precepts of Mohammed as those of an ambitious reformer. The reason simply is that the critic should be of the same disposition of mind as that of the author, whose merits he is required to judge. Thoughts have different ways. One, who is trained up in the thoughts of the Unitarian Society or of the Vedānta of the Benares school will scarcely find piety in the faith of Vaiṣṇavas. An ignorant Vaiṣṇava, on the other hand, whose business it is to beg from door to door in the name of Nityānanda will find no piety in a Christian. This is because the Vaiṣṇava does not think in the way in which the Christian thinks of his own religion. It may be that both the Christian and the Vaiṣṇava will utter the same sentiment, but they will never stop their fight with each other only because they have arrived at their common conclusion by different ways of thought. Thus a great deal of ungenerousness enters into the arguments of the pious Christians when they pass their imperfect opinion on the religion of the Vaiṣṇavas."},{"class":"b44","text":" Subjects of philosophy and theology are like the peaks of large, towering, and inaccessible mountains standing in the midst of our planet inviting attention and investigation. Thinkers and men of deep speculation take their observations through the instruments of reason and consciousness. But they take different points when they carry on their work. These points are positions chalked out by the circumstances of their social and philosophical life, different as they are in the different parts of the world. Plato looked at the peak of the spiritual question from the West, and Vyās made the observation from the East; so Confucius did it from further East, and Schlegel, Spinoza, Kant, and Goethe from further West. These observations were made at different times and by different means, but the conclusion is all the same in as much as the object of observation was one and the same. They all hunted after the Great Spirit, the unconditioned Soul of the universe. They could not but get an insight into it. Their words and expressions are different, but their import is the same. They tried to find out the absolute religion, and their labours were crowned with success, for God gives all that He has to His children if they want to have it. It requires a candid, generous, pious, and holy heart to feel the beauties of their conclusions."},{"class":"b44","text":" Party spirit—that great enemy of truth—will always baffle the attempt of the enquirer, who tries to gather truth from religious work of his own nation and will make him believe that absolute truth is nowhere except in his old religious book. What better example could be adduced than the fact that the great philosopher of Benares will find no truth in the universal brotherhood of man and the common fatherhood of God? The philosopher, thinking in his own way of thought, can never see the beauty of the Christian faith. The way in which Christ thought of his own Father was love absolute, and so long as the philosopher will not adopt that way of thinking, he will ever remain deprived of the absolute faith preached by the Western saviour. In a similar manner, the Christian needs to adopt the way of thought which the Vedāntist pursued before he can love the conclusions of the philosopher. The critic, therefore, should have a comprehensive, good, generous, candid, impartial, and sympathetic soul."},{"class":"b52","text":" “What sort of a thing is the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>?”, asks the European gentleman newly arrived in India.

It contains a jargon of unintelligible and savage literature of those men who paint their noses with some sort of earth or sandal and wear beads all over their bodies in order to procure salvation for themselves. Another of his companions, who has traveled a little in the interior, would immediately contradict him and say that the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> is a Sanskrit work claimed by a sect of men, the Goswāmīs, who give mantras, like the Popes of Italy, to the common people of Bengal and pardon their sins on payment of gold enough to defray their social expenses.

In these three words is summed up the whole ocean of human knowledge as far as it has been explored up to this era of human progress.

Created objects are subject to the influence of time and space, which form the chief ingredients of that principle in creation which passes by the name of māyā."},{"class":"b44","text":" Māyā is a thing which is not easily understood by us who are subject to it, but God explains, as much as we can understand in our present constitution, this principle through our spiritual perception. The hasty critic starts like an unbroken horse at the name of māyā and denounces it as a theory identical with that of Bishop Berkeley. “Be patient in your inquiry” is our immediate reply to him. In the mind of God there were ideas of all that we perceive in eternal existence with Him, or else God loses the epithet of omniscient so learnedly applied to Him. The imperfect part of nature implying want or non-existence of substance proceeded also from certain of those ideas, and what else, excepting a principle of māyā eternally existing in God subject to His omnipotence, could have a hand in the creation of the world as it is?

Certainly the theory is idealistic, but it has been degraded into foolishness by wrong explanations. The materialist laughs at the ideal theory saying how could this body, water, air, and earth be mere ideas without entity, and he laughs rightly when he takes Śaṅkar Āchārya’s book in his hand as the butt end of his ridicule.<span class=\\"e8\\">7</span>"},{"class":"b44","text":" The true idealist must be a dualist also.

Those who worship God as the Universal Soul in the principle of spiritual union with Him give Him the name of Paramātmā. This is yoga. Those who worship God as all-in-all with all their heart, body, and strength style Him as Bhagavān. This last principle is bhakti."},{"class":"b44","text":" The book that prescribes the relation and worship of Bhagavān procures for itself the name of <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>, and the worshipper is also called by the same name.<span class=\\"e8\\">8</span>"},{"class":"b44","text":" Such is the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> which is decidedly <span class=\\"e3\\">the book</span> for all classes of theists. If we worship God spiritually as all-in-all with our heart, mind, body, and strength, we are called Bhāgavatas, and we lead a life of spiritualism, which neither the worshipper of Brahma nor the yogī uniting his soul with Paramātmā, the Universal Soul, can obtain."},{"class":"b44","text":" The superiority of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> consists in the uniting of all sorts of theistic worship into one excellent principle in human nature, which passes by the name of bhakti. This word has no equivalent in the English language. Piety, devotion, resignation, and spiritual love, unalloyed with any sort of petition except in the way of repentance, compose the highest principle of bhakti. The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> tells us to worship God in that great and invaluable principle, which is infinitely superior to human knowledge and the principle of yoga."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our short compass will not admit of an explanation of the principle of bhakti beautifully rising from its first stage of application in the form of Brahmic worship in the shape of admiration which is styled the śānta-rasa, to the fifth or the highest stage of absolute union in love with God, sweetly styled the madhura-rasa of prema-bhakti. A full explanation will take a big volume which is not our object here to compose. Suffice it to say that the principle of bhakti passes five distinct stages in the course of its development into its highest and purest form.<span class=\\"e8\\">9</span> Then again when it reaches the last form, it is susceptible of further progress from the stage of prema (love) to that of mahābhāva, which is in fact a complete transition into the spiritual universe where God alone is the bridegroom of our souls in the purest state."},{"class":"b44","text":" The voluminous <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> is nothing more than a full illustration of this principle of continual development and progress of the soul from gross matter to the all-perfect Universal Spirit who is distinguished as personal, eternal, absolutely free, all-powerful, and all-intelligent. There is nothing gross or material in this process. The whole affair is spiritual. In order to impress this spiritual picture upon the student who attempts to learn it, comparisons have been made with the material world, which cannot but convince the ignorant and the novice or unpracticed in this process. Material examples are absolutely necessary for the explanation of spiritual ideas. The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> believes that the spirit of nature is the truth in nature and is the only practical part of it."},{"class":"b44","text":" The phenomenal appearance of nature is truly theoretical, although it has had the greatest claim upon our belief from the days of our infancy. The outward appearance of nature is nothing more than a sure index of its spiritual phase. Comparisons are therefore necessary. Nature, as it is before our eyes, must explain the spirit, or else the truth will ever remain concealed, and man will never rise from his boyhood, though his whiskers and beard grow white as the snows of the Himalayas. The whole intellectual and moral philosophy is explained by matter itself. Emerson beautifully shows how all the words in moral philosophy originally came from the names of material objects. The words heart, head, spirit, thought, courage, and bravery were originally the common names of some corresponding objects in the material world."},{"class":"b44","text":" All spiritual ideas are similarly pictures from the material world, because matter is the dictionary of spirit, and material pictures are but the shadows of the spiritual affairs which our material eye carries back to our spiritual perception. God in His infinite goodness and kindness has established this unfailing connection between the truth and the shadow in order to impress upon us. The clock explains the time, the alphabet points to the gathered store of knowledge, the beautiful song of a harmonium gives the idea of eternal harmony in the spirit-world, today and tomorrow and the day after tomorrow thrust into us the ungrasped idea of eternity, and similarly, material pictures impress upon our spiritual nature the truly spiritual idea of religion."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is on these reasonable grounds that Vyās adopted the mode of explaining our spiritual worship with some sorts of material phenomena, which correspond with the spiritual truth. Our object is not to go into details. So we are unable to quote some of the illustrations within the short compass of this lecture."},{"class":"b44","text":" We have also the practical part of the question in the eleventh book of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>. All of the modes by which a man can train himself up to prema-bhakti, as explained above, have been described at great length. We have been advised, first of all, to convert ourselves into most grateful servants of God as regards relation to our fellow brethren. Our nature has been described as bearing three different phases in all our bearings in the world. Those phases are named sattva, raja, and tama. Sattva-guṇa is that property in our nature which is purely good as far as it can be pure in our present state. Raja-guṇa is neither good nor bad. Tama-guṇa is evil. Our pravṛttis or tendencies and affections are described as the mainspring of all our actions, and it is our object in our life and conduct as well as thought to train up those affections and tendencies to the standard of sattva-guṇa as decided by the moral principle."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is not, however, easily done. All of the springs of our actions should be carefully protected from tama-guṇa, the evil principle, by adopting the raja-guṇa at first, and when that is effected, man should subdue his raja-guṇa by means of the natural sattva-guṇa, which is the most powerful of all three of them when cultivated. Lust, idleness, wicked deeds, and degradation of human nature by intoxicating principles are described as exclusively belonging to tama-guṇa, the evil phase of nature. These are to be checked by marriage, useful work, and abstinence from intoxication and trouble to our neighbors and inferior animals."},{"class":"b44","text":" Thus, when raja-guṇa has obtained supremacy in the heart, it is our duty to convert that raja-guṇa into sattva-guṇa, which is pre-eminently good. That married love, which is first cultivated, must now be sublimated into holy, good, and spiritual love, i.e., love between soul and soul. Useful work will now be converted into work of love and not of disgust or obligation. Abstinence from wicked work will be made to lose its negative appearance and converted into positive good work. Then we are to look to all living beings in the same light in which we look to ourselves, i.e., we must convert our selfishness into all possible disinterested activity towards all around us. Love, charity, good deeds, and devotion to God will be our only aim. We then become the servants of God by obeying His high and holy wishes."},{"class":"b44","text":" Here we begin to be bhaktas, and we are susceptible of further improvement in our spiritual nature, as we have described above. All this is covered by the term abhidheya, the second cardinal point in the supreme religious work, the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>."},{"class":"b44","text":" We have now before us the first two cardinal points in our religion explained somehow or other in the terms and thoughts expressed by our saviour who lived only four and a half centuries ago in the beautiful town of Nadia situated on the banks of the Bhāgīrathī. We must now proceed to the last cardinal point termed by that great re-establisher as prayojan or prospects."},{"class":"b44","text":" What is the object of our spiritual development, our prayer, our devotion, and our union with God? The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> tells that the object is not enjoyment or sorrow, but continual progress in perfectly attaining spiritual holiness and symmetry or harmony both within and all around in perfect bliss.<span class=\\"e8\\">10</span>"},{"class":"b44","text":" In the common place books of the Hindu religion in which the raja- and tama-guṇas have been described as the ways of religion, we have descriptions of a local heaven and a local hell; the heaven as beautiful as anything on earth, and the hell as ghastly as any picture of evil. Besides this heaven, we have many more places where good souls are sent up in the way of promotion. There are eighty-four divisions of the hell itself; some more dreadful than the one that Milton has described in his <span class=\\"e3\\">Paradise Lost</span>. These are certainly poetical and were originally created by the rulers of the country in order to check evil deeds of the ignorant people, who are not able to understand the conclusions of philosophy."},{"class":"b44","text":" The religion of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> is free from such a poetic imagination. Indeed, in some of the chapters, we meet with descriptions of these hells and heavens and accounts of curious tales, but we have been warned, somewhere in the book, not to accept them as real facts but as inventions to overawe the wicked and to improve the simple and the ignorant. The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> certainly tells us of a state of reward and punishment in the future according to deeds in our present situation. All poetic inventions, besides this spiritual fact, have been described as statements borrowed from other works in the way of preservation of old traditions in the book which superseded them all and put an end to the necessity of their storage."},{"class":"b44","text":" If the whole stock of Hindu theological works which preceded the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> were burnt like the Alexandrian library and the sacred <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> preserved as it is, not a part of the philosophy of the Hindus except that of the atheistic sects would be lost. The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>, therefore, may be styled both as a religious work and a compendium of all Hindu history, culture, and philosophy."},{"class":"b44","text":" The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> does not allow its followers to ask anything from God except eternal love towards Him.<span class=\\"e8\\">11</span> The kingdom of the world, the beauties of the local heavens, and sovereignty over the material world are never the subjects of Vaiṣṇava prayer."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Vaiṣṇava meekly and humbly says, “Father, Master, God, friend, and husband of my soul! Hallowed be Thy Name! I do not approach You for anything which You have already given me. I have sinned against You, and I now repent and solicit Your pardon. Let Thy holiness touch my soul and make me free from grossness. Let my spirit in all humility be devoted completely to Your holy service in absolute love towards Thee. I have called You my God, and let my soul be inspired in admiration at Your greatness! I have addressed You as my Master, and let my soul be unflinchingly devoted to Your service. I have called You my friend, and let my soul remain overwhelmed in reverential love towards You and not in dread or fear! I have called You my husband, and let my spiritual nature be in eternal union with You, forever loving and never dreading or feeling disgust. Father, let me have strength enough to go to You as the consort of my soul, so that we may be one in eternal Love! Peace to the world!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Of such a nature is the prayer of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>. One who can read the book will find the highest form of prayer in the expressions of Prahlād towards the universal and omnipresent Soul with powers to convert all unholy strength into meek submission or entire annihilation. This prayer will show what is the end and object of a Vaiṣṇava’s life. He does not entertain any ambition to be the king of a certain part of the universe in his next life after death, nor does he dread a local, fiery, and turbulent hell, the idea of which would make the hairs of young Hamlet stand erect like the forks of a porcupine! His idea of salvation is not total annihilation of personal existence as Buddhists and the twenty-four Gods of the Jains procured for themselves! The Vaiṣṇava is the meekest of all creatures and completely freed from all ambition. He wants to serve God spiritually after death as he has served Him both in spirit and matter while in this life. His constitution is a pure spirit, and his highest object of life is the attainment of divine and holy love both here and hereafter."},{"class":"b44","text":" Here may arise a philosophical doubt. How the human soul could have a distinct existence from the universal Soul when the gross part of the human constitution will be no more? The Vaiṣṇava can’t answer it, nor can any man on earth explain it satisfactorily. The Vaiṣṇava meekly answers. He feels the truth, but he cannot understand it. The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> merely affirms that the Vaiṣṇava soul, when freed from gross matter, will distinctly exist not in time and space but spiritually in the eternal spiritual kingdom of God where love is life, and hope and charity and continually increasing ecstasy without change are its various manifestations."},{"class":"b44","text":" In understanding the true essence of the Deity, two great errors confront us and frighten us back to ignorance and its satisfaction. One of them is the idea that God is above all attributes, both material and spiritual, and is consequently above all conception. This is a noble idea but useless. If God is above conception and without any sympathy with the world, how was then this creation possible? This universe composed of properties feasible? The distinctions and phases of existence evidenced? The difference of value witnessed? Man, woman, beast, trees, magnetism, animal magnetism, electricity, landscape, water, and fire distinctly seen? In that case, Śaṅkar Āchārya’s māyāvād theory would have been absolute philosophy."},{"class":"b44","text":" The other error is that God is all attributes, i.e., intelligence, truth, goodness, and power. This is also a ludicrous idea. Scattered properties can never constitute a being. It is more impossible in the cases of co-existence of incoherent, incompatible, mutually opposed, or even belligerent principles, such as justice and mercy, and fullness and creative power, and so forth. Both ideas are imperfect."},{"class":"b44","text":" The truth, as stated in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>, is that properties, though many of them opposed or belligerent in nature, are united in a spiritual Being where they have full congruity, unity, sympathy, and harmony. Certainly this is beyond our comprehension. It is so owing to our nature being finite and God being infinite. Our ideas are constrained by the idea of space and time, but God is above any sort of limit or constraint. This is a glimpse of truth, and we must regard it as truth itself. Often, says Emerson, a glimpse of truth is better than an arranged system, and he is right.<span class=\\"e8\\">12</span>"},{"class":"b44","text":" The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> has, therefore, a transcendental personal, all-intelligent, active, absolutely free, holy, good, all-powerful, omnipresent, just and merciful, and supremely spiritual Deity without a second, creating and preserving all that is in the universe. The highest object of the Vaiṣṇava is to serve that infinite being forever spiritually in the activity of absolute love."},{"class":"b44","text":" These are the main principles of the philosophy and religion inculcated by the work called the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>, and Vyās, in his great wisdom, tried his best to explain all these principles with the aid of pictures perceivable in the material world. The shallow critic will no doubt hastily and summarily reject this great philosopher as a man-worshipper. He would go so far as to scandalise him as a teacher of material love and the injurious principles of exclusive asceticism."},{"class":"b44","text":" The critic should first read deeply the pages of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> and train his mind up to the best eclectic philosophy which the world has ever obtained, and then we are sure he will pour panegyrics upon the great principal of the college of theology at Badrīk Ashram which existed not less than 4,000 years ago."},{"class":"b44","text":" The shallow critic’s mind will undoubtedly be changed if he but reflects upon only one great and fundamental point, i.e., how it could at all be possible that a spiritualist of the rank and school of Vyās, teaching the best principles of theism throughout the whole of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>, and composing the four texts quoted in the beginning as the foundation of his mighty work, could have created upon the belief of men the idea that the sensual connection between a man with certain females is the highest object of worship! This is surely impossible, dear critic! Vyās could not have taught a common vairāgī to set up an ākhaḍā (a place of worship) with a number of females, if found anywhere! Vyās, who could teach us repeatedly in the whole of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> that sensual pleasures are momentary like the pleasure of rubbing the itching hand and that man’s highest duty is to have spiritual love with God, could never have prescribed the worship of, or even any indulgence in, sensual pleasures.<span class=\\"e8\\">13</span>"},{"class":"b44","text":" His descriptions are undoubtedly thoroughly spiritual, and you must not connect matter of the gross world with it. Following this advice, dear critic, go through the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>, and I doubt not you will, in three months, weep and repent to God for having despised this great and noble revelation emanating through the heart and brain of the great Bādarāyaṇ."},{"class":"b44","text":" Yes, you nobly tell us that such philosophical comparisons produced injury in the ignorant and the thoughtless. You nobly point to the immoral deeds of the common and perverted vairāgīs, who shamelessly have the hardihood to call themselves “the followers of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> and the great Chaitanya.” You nobly tell us that Vyās, unless purely explained, may lead thousands of men into great risk and trouble in time to come. But dear critic! Study the history of ages and countries. Where have you found the philosopher and the reformer fully understood by the people?"},{"class":"b44","text":" The popular religion is fear of God and not the pure spiritual love which Plato, Vyās, Jesus, and Chaitanya taught to their respective peoples. Whether you give the Absolute religion in figures or simple expressions or teach them by means of books or oral speeches, the ignorant and the thoughtless must degrade it. It is indeed very easy to tell and sweet to hear that Absolute Truth has such an affinity with the human soul that He comes through it as if intuitively. No exertion is necessary to teach the precepts of true religion. This is a deceptive idea."},{"class":"b44","text":" It may be true of ethics and of the mere alphabet of religion but not of the highest form of faith which requires an exalted soul to understand. It certainly requires previous training of the soul in the elements of religion; just as the student of the fractions must have a previous attainment in the elemental numbers and figures in arithmetic and geometry. “Truth is good” is an elemental truth which is easily grasped by the common people. But if you tell a common uneducated man that God is infinitely intelligent and powerful in His spiritual nature, he will conceive a different idea from what you yourself entertain of the expression."},{"class":"b44","text":" All higher truths, though intuitive, are realisable only through education beginning from the simple and elementary principles of religion. That religion is the purest which gives you the purest idea of God, and the absolute religion requires an absolute conception by man of his own spiritual nature. How, then, is it possible that the ignorant will ever be able to obtain the absolute religion as long they are ignorant of the basic teachings and philosophy of religion? It is only when thought awakens that the thinker no longer remains ignorant and becomes naturally capable of obtaining an absolute idea of religion."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is a truth, and God has made it such in His infinite goodness, impartiality, and mercy. Labour has its wages, and the idle must never be rewarded. “Higher the work, greater is the reward” is a useful maxim of truth. The thoughtless must necessarily remain satisfied with mere superstition till he wakes and opens his eyes to the God of love."},{"class":"b44","text":" The reformers, out of their universal love and solicitude for rendering good to all, sincerely endeavor by some means or other to make the thoughtless drink the cup of salvation, but the latter drink it with wine and fall to the ground benumbed under the influence of intoxication because the imagination has also the power of making a thing what it never was. It is in this way that the evils of nunneries and the corruption of the ākhaḍās commenced. No, we must not minimise or scandalise the saviour of Jerusalem or the saviour of Nadia for these subsequent evils of some perverted followers. Luthers, in spite of such cheap critics, are just what we want for the correction of those evils by means of true interpretation of the original precepts."},{"class":"b44","text":" Two more principles characterise the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>, viz., liberty and progress of the soul throughout eternity. The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> teaches us that God gives us truth as He gave it to Vyās, and for us all, when we earnestly seek for it. Truth is eternal and inexhaustible. The soul receives a revelation of truth only when he is really anxious for it. The souls of the great thinkers of the by-gone ages, who now live spiritually, often approach our inquiring spirit and assist it in its proper and gradual development. Thus Vyās was assisted by Nārad and Brahmā."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our many śāstras, or in other words, books of thought, do not contain all that we could get from the infinite Father. No book is without its errors. God’s revelation is no doubt absolute truth, but it is scarcely received and preserved in its natural and pristine purity."},{"class":"b44","text":" We have been advised in the fourteenth chapter of the eleventh skandha of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span><span class=\\"e8\\">14</span> to believe that truth, when revealed, is absolute, but the same is liable to be imbued with the tincture of the nature of the receiver in course of time and is thus completely changed and converted into error through continual exchange of hands from age to age. Consequently sincere revelations from authentic sources are continually necessary in order to keep up truth in its original purity."},{"class":"b44","text":" We are thus warned to be careful in our studies of old authors, however wise they are reputed to be. Here we have full liberty to reject any wrong idea which is not sanctioned by the peace of conscience."},{"class":"b44","text":" Vyās was not satisfied with what he collected in the Vedas, arranged in the Purāṇas, and composed in the Mahābhārata. The peace of his conscience did not sanction his labors. It dictated him from inside, “No, Vyās! You cannot rest contented with the erroneous picture of truth which was necessarily presented to you by the sages of by-gone days! You must yourself knock at the door of the inexhaustible store of truth from which the former sages drew their wealth. Go, go up to the fountainhead of truth, where no pilgrim meets with disappointment of any kind.” Vyās did it and obtained what he wanted. We have been all advised to do so."},{"class":"b44","text":" Liberty then is the principle which we must appreciate as the most valuable gift of God. We must not allow ourselves to be led by those who lived and thought before us. We must think for ourselves and try to get further truths which are still undiscovered or unadapted in the present conditions and circumstances for purpose of our realisation of the same."},{"class":"b51","text":" In the twenty-third text of the twenty-first chapter of eleventh skandha of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>, we have been advised to take the spirit of the śāstras and not the words."},{"class":"b81","text":" फलश्रुतिरियं नृणां न श्रेयो रोचनं परम् ।<br />श्रेयोविवक्षया प्रोक्तं यथा भैषज्यरोचनम् ॥"},{"class":"b60","text":" phala-śrutir iyaṁ nṛṇāṁ na śreyo rochanaṁ param <br />śreyo-vivakṣayā proktaṁ yathā bhaiṣajya-rochanam"},{"class":"b43","text":" The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> stands therefore for a religion of liberty, of unmixed truth, and of absolute love."},{"class":"b44","text":" The other characteristic is progress. Liberty certainly is the father of all progress. Holy liberty is the cause of progress upwards and upwards in eternity and in endless activity of love. Liberty abused causes degradation, and the Vaiṣṇava must always carefully use this benign and beautiful gift of God. The progress of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> is described as the rise of the soul from nature up to nature’s God, from māyā, the absolute and the infinite energy, to the transcendental absolute Person Himself."},{"class":"b51","text":" Hence the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> says about itself:"},{"class":"b81","text":" निगमकल्पतरोर्गलितं फलं शुकमुखादमृतद्रवसंयुतम् ।<br />पिवत भागवतं रसमालयं मुहुरहो रसिका भुवि भावुकाः ॥"},{"class":"b59","text":" nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalaṁ<br />śuka-mukhād amṛta-drava-saṁyutam<br />pibata bhāgavataṁ rasam ālayaṁ<br />muhur aho rasikā bhuvi bhāvukāḥ"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad Bhāgavatam: 1.1.3)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “It is the fruit of the tree of thought, mixed with the nectar of the speech of Śukadev.

In Vṛndāvan, the gopīs serve Śrī Kṛṣṇa by unconventional amorous love.

The spiritual value of the varṇāśram system is due to the fact that it admits the possibility of the activity of conditioned souls being endowed with reflected spiritual quality by being directed towards the unalloyed service of the Absolute on the transcendental plane. It is the purpose of the varṇāśram regulation to impart this direction to the activity of conditioned souls.

Neither is it on a par with the life of unmixed sensuousness that is led by people outside the varṇāśram society. Every form of activity of conditioned souls outside the varṇāśram system is inspired by meaningless malicious hostility towards the Absolute. All such activity is necessarily atheistic. This mundane world is the congenial sphere for the practice of the deluded dominating activity that is coveted by conditioned souls for practising active aversion towards the Absolute. The conditions for such activity are supplied by the deluding power. They constitute the realm of nescience, spiritual ignorance or achit.

Śrī Gurudev belongs to this inner group of the servitors. He is the divine manifested entity for disclosing the forms and activities of all eternal servitors of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The function of Śrī Gurudev is a fundamental fact in the līlā of Vraja where Śrī Kṛṣṇa is served as the emporium of all the rasas.

It is, however, possible to be reconciled, to some extent, to the truth of the narrative of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> if we are prepared to admit the reasonableness of the doctrine that the mundane world is the unwholesome reflection of the realm of the Absolute and that this world appears in a scale of values that is the reverse of that which it obtains in reality, of which it happens to be the shadow."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the form of the narrative of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span>, the transcendental Vraja-līlā manifests its descent to the plane of our mundane vision in the symbolic shapes resembling those of the corresponding mundane events.

A person belonging to the varṇāśram society can readily appreciate the transparent moral purity of life on the plane of Vaikuṇṭha and Ayodhyā, although he cannot understand their esoteric nature. In those realms, Godhead poses as the ideal monogamous husband. Ethical restrictions of sex relationship that are imposed at Ayodhyā by the form of the monogamous marriage are relaxed at Dvārakā where the Absolute manifests His fuller personality and appears in the guise of the polygamous husband. The conventions of marriage are abrogated in Vṛndāvan where the sanctity of wedlock becomes secondary and a foil to the amorous exploits of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in His fullest manifestation."},{"class":"b44","text":" The spiritual function in its unalloyed form has a real correspondence to mundane activity with the distinction that its objective mode of activity and instrumental are unalloyed spirit.

When Śrī Kṛṣṇa is pleased, His servitors experience unmixed joy. This is the reverse of what happens in this world. Activity that yields enjoyment to the person indulging in the same alone possesses attraction on the mundane plane. But such selfish pleasure is never coveted on the plane of spiritual service. The plane of mundane sensuous enjoyment is thereby sharply differentiated from that of spiritual service in respect of the quality and orientation of their respective activities. Desire for mundane enjoyment is potentially, but uncongenially, inherent in the soul, and it can be cultivated at his option. The practice of it, however, leads to the abeyance of his truly natural serving function. Modern civilisation does not suspect its own degradation in seeking exclusively for mundane enjoyment. The mind and body of man have a natural aptitude for sensuous gratification, and all his ordinary mundane activities are practised for its realisation."},{"class":"b44","text":" For this reason very few people in this world can grasp the significance of the statement of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> and other spiritual scriptures that the unalloyed essence of the soul has a natural aptitude for the exclusive service of the Absolute which is utterly incompatible with mundane sensuous living."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the transcendental service of the Absolute, the aptitude, form, as well as ingredients are uncovered, absolutely wholesome living reality.
