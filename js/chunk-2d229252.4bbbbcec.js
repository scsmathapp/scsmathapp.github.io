Throughout his whole life, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj practised what he preached. The sincere practitioners are themselves an introduction to the subject of genuine, joyful, spiritual life, but they are not able to visit everyone personally. Therefore, we are taking the opportunity afforded by the modern scientific age in order to print books to broadcast widely such wisdom. The vibration emanating from a printing press in this way can beneficially influence not only this mundane world, but it can even conquer souls already established in the spiritual plane. It is, therefore, very joyful and satisfying to see the manifestation of this publication, <span class=\\"e3\\">Home Comfort—An Introduction to Inner Fulfilment</span>. It is a selection from our Divine Master’s lectures introducing the subject of theistic spiritual life, and, for the service of his Divine Mission, it has been reproduced in print by the sincere efforts of the student practitioners here."},{"class":"b44","text":" Up to his last days, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj bestowed his mercy upon the conditioned souls in the form of lectures which he would sometimes deliver continuously hour after hour.

In a scientific way, I shall try to explain the subject to you, in general, independently of all religious conceptions."},{"class":"b51","text":" First of all, we should understand that there are three planes of life: the plane of mundane enjoyment, the plane of renunciation, and the plane of dedication. The plane of enjoyment is where we are at present, more or less. Mundane enjoyment means exploitation; and without exploitation, none can exist in this plane."},{"class":"b81","text":" अहस्तानि सहस्तानामपदानि चतुष्पदाम् ।<br />फल्गूनि तत्र महतां जीवो जीवस्य जीवनम् ॥"},{"class":"b60","text":" ahastāni sahastānām apadāni chatuṣpadām<br />phalgūni tatra mahatāṁ jīvo jīvasya jīvanam"},{"class":"b43","text":" “Those with hands live off those that have none. Four-footed animals live on grass, creepers, etc., and the large live off the small.” Everything is full of life. Creepers, grass, and trees also have life, but without exploitation none can maintain their body in this plane."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is the plane of exploitation, and, as Newton’s third law says, to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. By exploitation one incurs some debt, and to clear that debt he will have to go down. In this way, there are so many jīvas or souls going up and down, up and down, due to action and reaction in the plane of exploitation. Society is trying to exploit to the utmost; everywhere there is the attempt to live at the cost of others. Without it, life is impossible because this is the plane of exploitation."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Buddhists, the Jains, the followers of Śaṅkar, and so many others are trying to get out of this entanglement of exploitation and find a life where there is no exploitation, no action and reaction. To avoid action and reaction, they try to find a position of renunciation, and they come to a conception similar to dreamless sleep, that of samādhi: to withdraw completely from the objective world and remain in the subjective plane. Without allowing their feelings to move into the lower plane, they always keep a subjective position, and that is something like dreamless sleep."},{"class":"b51","text":" The Vaiṣṇava section—those who serve the Supreme Lord—are of the opinion that there is another world, the world of dedication. That dedication is just the opposite of exploitation. In the mundane plane, every unit wants to exploit the environment, whereas in the plane of dedication every unit wants to serve the environment; the real key to the life of that plane is to serve the Centre. We are living in an organic whole, so every point must be true to the organic Centre. The explanation is given in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> (4.31.14) by the analogy of serving the root of a tree:"},{"class":"b81","text":" यथा तरोर्मूलनिषेचनेन<br />तृप्यन्ति तत्स्कन्धभुजोपशाखाः ।<br />प्राणोपहाराच्च यथेन्द्रियाणां<br />तथैव सर्व्वार्हणमच्युतेज्या ॥"},{"class":"b60","text":" yathā taror mūla-niṣechanena<br />tṛpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaśākhāḥ<br />prāṇopahārāch cha yathendriyāṇāṁ<br />tathaiva sarvārhaṇam achyutejyā"},{"class":"b50","text":" In the Vedic literature also, we find it said, “Try to find the one by knowing whom everything is known.”"},{"class":"b81","text":" यस्मिन्विज्ञाते सर्व्वमिदं विज्ञातं भवति ।<br />यस्मिन्प्राप्ते सर्व्वमिदं प्राप्तं भवति ।<br />तद्विजिज्ञासस्व तदेव ब्रह्म ॥"},{"class":"b60","text":" yasmin vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati<br />yasmin prāpte sarvam idaṁ prāptaṁ bhavati<br />tad vijijñāsasva tad eva brahma"},{"class":"b43","text":" There is a central point by knowing which everything is known, and by attaining which everything is attained. The long and short of the entire Vedic advice is to try to seek out that Centre. In the beginning, some may think this to be a ludicrous claim. “By knowing one, everything is known, by getting one, everything is got—what is this? Only a madman can say such a thing!” So, an analogy is given in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>: when you pour water onto the root of a tree, the whole tree is fed, and if you put food into the stomach, the whole body is fed; similarly, if you do service to the Centre, everything is served. It is possible, and to do that means to enter the plane of dedication. Avoiding the plane of exploitation, and also that of renunciation, try to enter the plane of dedication. Your ātmā, your soul proper, is a member of that plane. That is the real world, whereas this is the perverted reflection."},{"class":"b44","text":" The real world is where every unit is dedicating itself to the whole, represented by the Centre, just as in a healthy body every atom will work for the welfare of the whole body. If an atom works for itself, it exploits to the extreme, and such local works for local interest are clearly bad. Every part of the body and every atom must work for the welfare of the whole system. There is a centre, and by the guidance of that, it will work."},{"class":"b51","text":" What is the position of the Centre? It is mentioned in <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>,"},{"class":"b81","text":" सर्व्वधर्म्मान् परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज ।"},{"class":"b59","text":" sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja"},{"class":"b54","text":" (18.66)"},{"class":"b43","text":" Kṛṣṇa explains His position: “Abandon all dharmas or duties and just surrender unto Me.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Now I want to represent this conception from another standpoint. Hegel was a good German philosopher, and in his philosophy he has given a concept: the Absolute Truth, the Prime Cause of everything, must have two qualifications. What are they? It must be by itself and for itself."},{"class":"b44","text":" Please try to pay attention. ‘By itself’ means that He is His own cause—nothing else created Him. If anything has created Him, that creator will have the primary importance. Therefore, to be the Absolute, He must be anādi, eternally existing and not created by anything. The Absolute must have this qualification."},{"class":"b44","text":" The next qualification is that the Absolute Truth is ‘for itself’. He exists for His own satisfaction, not to satisfy any other. If His existence was for the purpose of satisfying any other entity, that would make Him secondary and He would not hold the prime position."},{"class":"b44","text":" Therefore, the Absolute must have these two qualifications: He is His own cause, and He exists only to satisfy Himself, to fulfil His own purpose. The Absolute is by itself and for itself. If even a blade of grass moves, it moves to fulfil the purpose of the Absolute. Everything—every incident, and whatever happens—must have to be for His satisfaction. So the real current is His līlā, His Pastimes. We are guided by separate interest: family interest, country interest, social interest or humanitarianism, etc., but in the infinite consideration it is all only a tiny part, and we are all engaged in acting for such separate interest. There is a clash between innumerable separate interests, and so there is trouble. But we must leave all our so-called special interests, come out from misunderstanding, and try to attain the function of a unit active for the cause of the whole."},{"class":"b51","text":" The conclusion of <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> given by Kṛṣṇa is “<span class=\\"e3\\">Sarva-dharmān parityajya</span>—give up all your duties which you think at present you have to discharge, and—<span class=\\"e3\\">Mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span>—surrender to My feet.”"},{"class":"b81","text":" अहं त्वां सर्व्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुचः ।"},{"class":"b60","text":" ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śuchaḥ"},{"class":"b43","text":" “I shall relieve you of all the troubles of which you can ever conceive.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In other words, you must remember to be faithful to the Centre. At present, all your respective duties are for local interest, but give up the local identification of your own interest and merge totally in the interest of the organic whole."},{"class":"b44","text":" We see that if a police officer takes even three rupees for his own purpose, he is punished, but if he kills so many for the interest of the country, he is rewarded. Similarly, whatever is done for the satisfaction of the whole is good, but if you do anything for yourself or any local friend, you will have to be punished. In an industry, we have no right to take a bribe for our personal purpose, and at the same time we have no right to call a strike, to close down the labour force, for then the industry will be destroyed."},{"class":"b44","text":" Neither exploitation nor renunciation will do. Exploitation is clearly bad, and because we have no right to go on strike, renunciation is also bad. In an organic whole, the common interest is that everyone must be dedicated to the Centre, and to the Centre means to the whole. When we put food into the stomach, the stomach will distribute it properly to every corner according to the necessity. That sort of life is Vaiṣṇavism. There is an organic whole, and we are a part of that. We have our special duties in connection with the whole, and that is proper dedication to the whole. We are not to put food into the eye, the nose or the ear, or anywhere except the stomach. Only when the food is properly distributed will the whole organism be healthy. We are all parts of the whole universe, and our duty is to work for the whole, and that is devotion, dedication, surrender. And how are we to know about that? We will receive help from the revealed scriptures, and from the many saints and agents who are also coming from that plane to bring us into harmony."},{"class":"b44","text":" The religion of highest harmony has been given by Mahāprabhu Śrī Chaitanyadev who explained devotion on the basis of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, the book which is understood to be the real conclusion of all the revealed scriptures. In this way, He explained that energy or power is not the highest thing, but knowledge is above it. Knowledge can control power and give a beneficial result. But in a higher plane, even knowledge takes a lower position. Above knowledge is love and affection, and that is the highest. Neither knowledge nor power, but only affection can give us fulfilment of life."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mercy is higher than justice. Justice only exists where there is the necessity for law and order, but in the realm of the Absolute Autocrat, who is the absolute good, there can be no question of any apprehension about Him. He is absolute good, and absolute good is absolute love and affection, and that is home! Back to God, back to home. What is home? It is where we find that we are in the midst of our well-wishers. Even if we do not care for our own benefit, there are so many who will take care of us—in fact the whole environment will take care of us—and that is home. That is the domain of the Absolute, and we can enter into His service, the highest position, and thereby see the affection, love, harmony, and beauty that exist there. All these qualities are similar, and they constitute the nature of the Prime Cause and Good, and we must go there."},{"class":"b44","text":" Misusing our free will, we have somehow gone astray. But now we are being called, “Come home, back to God and back to home, the highest position, the land of love.” This is, in general and in short, the sum total of all I have said to you—this is the Kṛṣṇa conception in <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, and it is the conception that has been given by Śrī Chaitanyadev. This Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh and the whole of the Gauḍīya Mission is preaching only for that. “Go to the Centre, use your life for total dedication to the Centre, and the Centre is all above justice. It is all-merciful, affectionate, loving, and beautiful.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" This is a general background of Vaiṣṇava religion, of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, and a brief overview of all conceptions of religion—that is, exploitation, renunciation, and dedication are the three planes of life, and the soul proper is a member of the land of dedication. All are dedicating units, but somehow, by misusing their partial free will, they have entered into the world of exploitation. Buddha, Jain, Pareśanāth, and others have helped those who want to withdraw from here to get out of the entanglement of exploitation—of action and reaction—by complete retirement. They have said that after retirement, the soul can live happily. Still, there may be the possibility of again becoming entangled in this trap. But where the really free souls live, all are dedicating units, and when we want to trace what is harmonising them and maintaining them in that plane, we shall see that all are working for the whole, and the whole is represented by the one Absolute Good. We have to see all these things, and for this the human birth is very valuable. In connection with the sādhus—the saints, the agents—we shall try our best to get out of this entanglement and enter into the land of love, dedication, and affection."},{"class":"b52","text":" We have already published several books, and there are many ancient scriptures which also help us to understand properly and in a more detailed way all the ontological aspects of religion."}]},{"title":"Searching for Our Home","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b58","text":" Chapter Two"},{"class":"b47","text":" Searching for Our Home"},{"class":"b43","text":" Our real home is full of freedom and comfort. Everything we need is there. It is a place where there are natural transactions of faith, love, and affection. It is inconceivable. The Upaniṣads say, “Don’t venture to test the unthinkable plane with your reasoning. That plane really is beyond the capacity of your thought. It is under a different set of laws. Your mathematical calculations and conclusions in this world are acquainted with points, planes, and solids. At present, you are a man in the world of solids, and you have some limited association with planes and points in a somewhat abstract way, therefore how can you calculate about higher things of which you have no knowledge? The customs and laws of that country are all unknown to you, so you cannot try to debate those higher things. That plane is of quite a different nature.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" If your understanding is limited to the laws of water, how can you make calculations about air? Similarly, if you are familiar only with the laws of air, how can you make calculations within the sphere of ether? Therefore, don’t rush to bring within your experimental laboratory those items which are beyond the capacity of your thinking, for that will be foolishness."},{"class":"b44","text":" Higher things do exist, but the general man in this world has no knowledge about them. We are indeed experiencers and have some knowledge, but only to a particular degree and standard. We cannot venture to calculate what is beyond our reach. But if those who actually have experience of that plane will come to us and give us some information, then we can make some comparison: “This gentleman of a particular experience of ether has written in this way, another gentleman who has experience and has also researched into the nature of ether has written in another particular manner.” In this way, we can gain some understanding from their investigation and their real connection with the subject matter."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the section of those investigating telescopes, we can make a comparison of their findings. The experience of one researcher with his telescope is of a certain type, and we can also learn about the experience of others with their particular telescopes. With the information available to us from their actual connection with the telescopes and their experiments, we may be able to conclude that perhaps a certain telescope was more powerful, another more powerful in a particular field, etc. So, we have some limited capacity to compare what has been discovered beyond our senses by means of the telescope, even though we ourselves may not have a telescope."},{"class":"b51","text":" The subject of the higher things discovered by the mental ‘telescope’ or the soul’s ‘telescope’ has been dealt with in the scriptures. Such subject matter is known by the saints, and we have to take their help in order to have entrance into that land. We are not at present in a position to have experience of the higher plane, but later, by the help of the saints and scriptures, when we ourselves have that type of ‘telescope’ vision, we will be able to have such a higher experience."},{"class":"b81","text":" स्वे स्वेऽधिकारे या निष्ठा स गुणः परिकीर्त्तितः ।"},{"class":"b60","text":" sve sve ’dhikāre yā niṣṭhā sa guṇaḥ parikīrtitaḥ"},{"class":"b50","text":" “Adherence to one’s own plane of qualification is laudable.”"},{"class":"b81","text":" अचिन्त्याः खलु ये भावा न तांस्तर्केण योजयेत् ।"},{"class":"b60","text":" achintyāḥ khalu ye bhāvā na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet"},{"class":"b43","text":" Don’t let the argumentative spirit overshadow everything. Argument is not all-in-all. It is not that it must be the resort of every belief.

Above all, we have to accommodate within our mind that sweetness is sweet, and truth is truth, however incomprehensible it may be, but we should not take any standard from here and apply it to that higher realm."},{"class":"b44","text":" If one has no eyes but another can see, the blind man will naturally seek help from the one who has vision. We are also blind to what is within ourselves, otherwise what is the necessity of consulting a doctor? The doctor can see what we cannot; he will diagnose the disease, and then we will undergo treatment. Naturally, we will have respect for his diagnosis and will give him something for his assistance. It is not unreasonable."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Guru is the specialist doctor, and we will understand his qualification when we come to see that what he says is real and not imaginary. Such vision will depend upon the degree of awakenment of the eye. If one who is blind is treated by a capable doctor, he will gradually directly perceive, “Yes, I begin to see something. I now have some eye-experience.” From that time on, he won’t care for the speculative opinions of the other blind people, but he will have his own direct capacity to see. With the coming of sight, he can understand that the application of the medicine has some real effect."},{"class":"b44","text":" Scientific understanding is also similar. In earlier days when Faraday discovered electricity, many people laughed, “What is this? It is mere curiosity. What utility can we have from this electricity?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" I once read an account of Faraday demonstrating an experiment to show the effect of his discovery. He generated electricity with a machine, and then he showed small pieces of paper being moved by that electric current.

Similarly, some consider that God consciousness is only a luxury, a fashion, or a play—that it has no practical application or direct utility. But when God consciousness becomes intense, those who experience it will see that all other activities, however apparently important, have no value. Why? Because ultimately we want to live. We don’t want to die."},{"class":"b44","text":" To live is the main and general necessity of us all. None can deny that they want to live, and not only live, but live happily, properly, and consciously.

We are making a transaction with the mortal world, but that won’t bring satisfaction; it can only drain our energy. What we gain on one side disappears on another. A wise man should neither accept nor tolerate this sort of waste of energy as the principle of life. Such a wise person can see another plane of life. He can see that he is not a party to this mortal world which is but a playground. He will feel, “I am immortal. I am a member of the eternal world, but I have somehow become entangled in this mortal aspect of existence. So, as soon as I can shake off this connection, I shall then stand in a normal position.” He will find that he himself—the soul, the feeler, the conceiver—is a member of another soil, but he has become entangled within this mortal pain-producing world. This is a miserable world. With the strength of his realisation, he can make advancement in his progress to the immortal plane."},{"class":"b44","text":" As positive proof comes before us we shall feel, “Now I see these things and hear these things, and this experience is all more real than the world about me.

There is a difference. Through the eye, ear, etc., we have some experience of this world, but concerning the soul, if we can withdraw from ‘progress’ in the negative side, we shall be able to feel, “Oh! This is the nature of the soul.” We shall directly feel who we are without the help of any instrument."},{"class":"b44","text":" The soul can see himself; he can focus upon himself, and through introspection he will realise his very nature. Through the process of introspection, the soul will perceive all possible conceptions of himself directly and without the help of any other instrument. He will then understand his own soil.

On that positive side he will discover, “I do not die.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The material plane is the plane of misrepresentation and misunderstanding, but in the higher plane there is no misunderstanding. Once admitted there, our conception, though it may be partial, will be clear and true.

He was so intense with his feeling that he did not give any value to his own life in this mundane world. He disconnected himself from this world because with great conviction he knew the soul to be immortal. Christ also was so much convinced of his Lord that he did not care for the happiness and pleasures of this world—he rejected it all."},{"class":"b44","text":" There are many things invisible to this fleshy eye that are visible with the eye of knowledge. We can concede that the eye of knowledge can see many things which the fleshy eye cannot. Similarly, a deep vision exists by which we can see things in a different, more hopeful way. The eye cannot see when it is covered by a cataract, but when the cataract is removed, the eye can see. Ignorance is like a cataract in our eye that causes us blindness. Our vision is only superficial, but deeper vision can see many things.

It is our body that is the member. If we can rise above the bodily conception, we can reach the mind, then on to the intelligence, then to the soul. We will find that the plane where the souls live is eternal, and the soul itself is also eternal. From there, we can go on to search after the Supersoul, the origin of all our thoughts. The Supersoul is likened to the sun which is the origin of all rays of light. Once we find a ray of light, we can approach the sun from which all rays emanate. Similarly, from the conception of our own selves, knowing ourselves to be particles of consciousness, we can seek out a plane of super-consciousness, super-knowledge, and super-existence. In this way, we can progress to the ultimate cause, the source of all. But we cannot go just according to our own whim and freedom; some sort of help from that plane is indispensable. Such help comes in the form of Guru, the Vaiṣṇavas, and other agents of that land. With their help, we can make honest progress towards the goal."},{"class":"b44","text":" At present we are as monarchs of all we survey, but what we survey is all transient, mortal, and reactionary.

The compiler of the Vedas, Vyāsdev, says the ātmā or soul is like that illuminating moon. Or, like the sun: a cloud has covered the sun, but the cloud is seen by the light of the sun. Similarly, the ātmā is a point of light within us, and because it is in the background we can feel our mental system. If the light is withdrawn, everything is dead. The mental system, the intelligence, the faculty of choice, and so many channels through which we gain knowledge from outside, will have no value if that light is withdrawn. That light is the ātmā, a point of a ray of light, and it is quite categorically different from all other things here. The soul is a particle of light, and there is a land of light made of souls, and in this way there is development again: from the subjective to super-subjective, from soul to Supersoul, ātmā to Paramātmā. Just as in this world we find ether, air, heat, water, then earth, then stone, and in this way there is development in material existence, similarly in the finer world there is also development from the intelligence to the soul, then to the Supersoul, to the Super-supersoul … In this way, the subjective side goes towards the infinite.

They say that consciousness is all-in-all, and everything is floating on the ocean of consciousness. That is subjective evolution. Darwin talks of objective evolution, but the Vedic scriptures say that everything comes under the category of subjective evolution.

It is impossible for the eye to see the mind; it can have some connection with the mind only when the latter cares to mind it.

In this connection, it should be clearly understood that an individual soul can never be substantially the same as the Absolute Person. Not even in his liberated or fully realised condition can an individual soul be one with Godhead. The misconception of oneness has been introduced from a slothful nondiscrimination between the Absolute Personality and the luminous orb around His eternal, spiritual, and blissful home. In fact, an individual soul constitutes only a part of a particular power of intermediate value of the Supreme Lord, and as such he is capable of being converted from both sides. He differs from the Absolute Entity both in quantity and quality, and is merely a dependent entity on the Absolute. In other words, the Absolute Lord Kṛṣṇa is the master, and an individual jīva-soul is His constitutional subordinate or servant."},{"class":"b44","text":" Such a relationship is constant and really wholesome for the jīva. The apprehension of slavery does not arise because of his free choice and immense positive gain. The freedom and individuality of the jīva are not only unharmed by surrender to the Absolute Good, but they really thrive in Him alone. Individual freedom and interest are the part and parcel of those who are of the Absolute, and so they are quite at home there, as a fish is at home in water or an animal in a healthy atmosphere. But the freedom as well as all other qualities of the Supreme Personality are unlimited and transcendental, and so only by their partial functions do they harmonise all relative entities."},{"class":"b52","text":" Śrī Guru is not exclusively the same as the Supreme Lord Himself, but he fully represents the essence of the whole normal potency and embodies the most comprehensive and excellent service and favour of the Lord. As he is the fittest servitor of the Lord, he is empowered by the Lord to reinstate all misguided souls in their best interest. So, Guru is the divine messenger of immortal hope and joy in this mortal and miserable world. His advent is the most auspicious and happy event for the suffering animation, and can be compared to the rising of the morning star that can guide the traveller lost in the desert.
