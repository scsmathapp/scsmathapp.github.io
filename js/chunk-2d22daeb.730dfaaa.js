Prior to Copernicus, it was believed that the earth was at the centre of the universe and that the sun and other planets orbited the earth. Until recently, in the Western world it has been thought that Christianity was the central conception of Divinity in the theistic universe. But as Western man has begun to gaze Eastward, he has discovered a plurality of theistic conceptions orbiting the Supreme Truth."},{"class":"b44","text":" Accepting that plurality, we must also accept the accompanying gradations of theism, superior and inferior. As the planets are situated according to their gravitational attraction for the sun, the varieties of theistic conception are situated higher or lower according to their attraction toward the Absolute Centre. The Kṛṣṇa conception of Divinity is one of being irresistibly drawn in attraction toward the infinite centre of all love, beauty, and harmony."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Infinite can make Himself known to the finite, and the divine agent through whom this function manifests is Śrī Guru or the divine guide. His Divine Grace Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī is an agent of Divinity and a messenger of that supreme reality. He has reminded us that we are all “sons of nectar”, and that we shall have to “die to live”, “dive deep into reality”, and enter the “land of dedication”. As much as we sacrifice ourselves in this plane, we shall become released from its influence and be drawn through dedication into the higher plane of reality where the divine Pastimes “move in a crooked way”. And there we will find the “hidden treasure of the Sweet Absolute” in the service of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī."},{"class":"b51","text":" His Divine Grace has informed us that the heart’s inner hankering for ecstasy, charm, and sweetness leads it in the search for Śrī Kṛṣṇa—Reality the Beautiful.

It is a mad search—an urgent campaign. With great earnestness, Kṛṣṇa comes to deliver His lost servants. Kṛṣṇa comes to take us home."},{"class":"b44","text":" In <span class=\\"e3\\">Bṛhad-Bhāgavatāmṛta</span>, it is written that once, as Kṛṣṇa and the cows were returning from the Vṛndāvan forest at the end of the day, a boy had just attained spiritual emancipation and entered Vṛndāvan as a cowherd boy (sakhya-rasa). Seeing His long lost servant, Kṛṣṇa embraced him and both of them fainted in ecstasy."},{"class":"b44","text":" All of Kṛṣṇa’s other cowherd friends were astounded, thinking, “What is this! Kṛṣṇa has lost His senses by embracing this newcomer? How is it possible!” Then, as all of the cowherd boys looked on astonished, Balarām came to Kṛṣṇa’s relief and somehow managed to rouse Him. Then, Kṛṣṇa addressed His friend with great affection: “Why did you stay away? Why have you been living away from home for so long? How was it possible for you? How could you bear My separation? You left Me, and you have been passing lives after lives without Me? Still, I know what trouble you took to return to Me. You searched for Me everywhere, and went to beg from house to house, and you were chastised by many, ridiculed by many, and you shed tears for Me. I know all these things. I was with you. And now, after great trouble, you have again come back to Me.” In this way, Kṛṣṇa addressed His long lost servant and welcomed him. And when Kṛṣṇa returned home, He took the newcomer by His side to take prasādam. In this way, a new recruit is earnestly welcomed by Kṛṣṇa Himself."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, the Lord’s search for His lost servants is a loving search; it is not ordinary, but from the heart. And the Lord’s heart is not an ordinary heart. Who can estimate what type of search He is engaged in? Although He is full in all respects, still He feels pangs of separation for every one of us, however small we may be. In spite of His supreme position, He has room for us in a corner of His loving heart. This is the nature of the infinite. Such an absolute autocrat, absolute good, is Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" An autocrat is not under law. It is not that if Kṛṣṇa gives Himself to one, another will be lacking. The Infinite is not like that; rather, there is an infinite supply at His command. So, He is the emporium of rasa (<span class=\\"e3\\">Akhila-rasāmṛta-mūrtiḥ</span>). And He is searching for His lost servants, to bring them home."},{"class":"b51","text":" Otherwise, we have no hope. Our solace, our consolation in life, is that ultimately we are under the care of such a loving Lord. Kṛṣṇa’s friends think, “What do we care for others? We have our Kṛṣṇa, our friend. “ That sort of inner encouragement, that desperate encouragement, comes from within. “Kṛṣṇa is there, He is our friend. What do we care about anything? We can take poison, we can jump on the head of that big serpent Kāliya, we can do anything. With Kṛṣṇa behind us, what do we care?” This sentiment is expressed by Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur in his <span class=\\"e3\\">Śaraṇāgati</span>."},{"class":"b60","text":" rakṣā karabi tuhu̐ niśchaya jāni<br />pāna karabu̐ hāma yāmuna-pāni"},{"class":"b50","text":" “Fearless and confident of Your protection, I shall drink the waters of the Yamunā, whether they are poisoned or not.

One devotee has said, “If Gaurāṅga had not come, how could we live? And who would inform us about our ultimate prospect in life?” We have such a great prospect. And yet, without Gaurāṅga, who would have come to inform us that we have so much wealth within? And Śrī Gaurāṅga says, “You do not know, but you have such a great magnitude of wealth.” His coming to inform us of our prospect is like the astrologer who reads a poor man’s horoscope and tells him, “Why are you living a poor life? You have immense wealth buried underground. Try to recover it. You are so great, and your guardian is so loving and so high, and yet you are wandering like a poor fellow in the street? What is this! You are not helpless; it is not that you have no guardian. You have only to remember your merciful guardian.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" In the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> (11.5.32), where the Kali-yuga-avatār is mentioned, we find evidence of the advent of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu.

He purifies all holy places of pilgrimage and great saintly persons by His touch and by His saṅkīrtan. He draws the highest things down from the highest plane. And even Brahmā and Śiva, puzzled by His noble gift, will begin to praise Him. They will eagerly aspire to take shelter under His lotus feet in surrender. The pains of all who come to serve Him will be removed, and their inner necessities will be fulfilled. And He will take care of those who take shelter of Him; they will be given protection as well as everything they may need. In this world where mortality rules, where we are continually experiencing the undesirable changes of repeated birth and death, in this area where no one wants to live, a great ship will come for us and take us within and carry us away from this unpleasant position. Let us fall at the feet of that great personality who comes to give us the highest nectar.”"},{"class":"b60","text":" tyaktvā sudustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīṁ<br />dharmiṣṭha ārya-vachasā yad agād araṇyam<br />māyā-mṛgaṁ dayitayepsitam anvadhāvad<br />vande mahāpuruṣa te charaṇāravindam"},{"class":"b43","text":" “O Supreme Lord, You gave up the goddess of fortune and her great opulence, which is most difficult to abandon and is sought after even by the gods.

At the same time, You are engaged in a search for Yourself, in a search for Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Reality the Beautiful.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" This verse generally applies to Lord Rāmachandra, who left His kingdom, and after going with Sītā Devī to the forest to discharge the duties designed by His father, chased after the māyā-mṛgam—the golden deer. Śrīla Viśvanāth Chakravartī Ṭhākur, however, shows how this verse also applies to Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. He says that the word <span class=\\"e3\\">māyā-mṛgam </span>means that Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu ran after the souls that are enveloped by māyā or misconception. The word <span class=\\"e3\\">māyā-mṛgam</span>, when applied to Rāmachandra, means that He ran after Marīchi, who had taken the form of a golden deer. When applied in the case of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, the words <span class=\\"e3\\">māyā-mṛgam anvadhāvad</span> mean, “He chased after those souls who are in illusion in order to deliver them. He ran in pursuit of the fallen souls as a savior, to deliver them from māyā or illusion.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Viśvanāth Chakravartī Ṭhākur has also given another interpretation: he says that <span class=\\"e3\\">dayitayā īpsitam</span> means, “It is desired by the beloved”, that is, the search for Kṛṣṇa. In this way, He identifies two qualities in the Chaitanya-avatār: He relieves the fallen souls, and He searches out Kṛṣṇa in the mood of His beloved (<span class=\\"e3\\">dayitayepsitam anvadhāvad</span>). Inspired by the mood of <span class=\\"e3\\">dayita</span>, His beloved, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, He ran after the souls in bondage to deliver them. Here, we find the scriptural reference, the seed of this conception. He is in quest of the lost souls, absorbed in a loving search for His lost servants."},{"class":"b44","text":" And throughout the whole life of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu and His other self, Nityānanda, it is very clear that They, being the Supreme Entity Themselves, are hunting after the fallen souls to deliver them. This will be the backbone of our conception of the Lord’s loving search for His lost servants."},{"class":"b51","text":" And it is also said:"},{"class":"b60","text":" yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata<br />abhyutthānam adharmasya tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham<br />paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya cha duṣkṛtām<br />dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya sambhavāmi yuge yuge"},{"class":"b43","text":" “Whenever and wherever religion declines and irreligion becomes prevalent, I advent Myself.

By accepting these statements as our starting point, we can see that He is always coming to this world to help the fallen souls, His own servants."},{"class":"b51","text":" What is the position of the fallen souls?

Yet although we see this conception in other countries and other religious traditions, in India it is found in a most profuse and systematic way.

And, as Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, Kṛṣṇa is also tasting His own sweetness. When He wants to distribute it to the devotees, the cause is His ecstatic potency (hlādinī-śakti). When Kṛṣṇa combines with His potency as Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, He becomes the Āchārya. So, Kṛṣṇa says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Āchāryaṁ Māṁ vijānīyān</span>: know that I am the Āchārya.” His Āchārya-lila is His self-distribution, and thereby He is taking His lost servants home. His recruitment is to distribute knowledge about Himself and devotion for Himself, and then to take them home."},{"class":"b52","text":" In Vṛndāvan, Kṛṣṇa is tasting rasa within His own circle, and in Nabadwīp, as Śrī Gaurāṅga with His group, He is tasting Himself and distributing that taste to others. His distribution and recruitment are one and the same. By distributing Himself, He is drawing our hearts to Him, taking us home.

And that movement is <span class=\\"e3\\">prati-padaṁ pūrṇāmṛtāsvādanaṁ</span>: at every point, every step, it produces a new type of joy which is infinite. It is not the stale and sterile joy we find here."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is the proper conception of the Absolute. The organic whole, which is always working and moving, is full, and its fullness is ever-new. It is not standing or static. It moves in such a way that at every second, every minute, it is always producing new, unknown, infinite joy. And we can purchase that joy only by paying the highest price: self-sacrifice. That ticket is very valuable which can give us admission into the plane of automatic moving joy which is ever-new at every second. And the ticket is wholesale self-sacrifice."},{"class":"b44","text":" That sacrifice is joyful, and one may taste that wonderful joy even here in this world, where at every moment everything is dying. It is give and take. If we want to gain something noble, we must also give. We must be generous in our dedication, and then we shall receive amply from that side. Wholesale self-dedication is the price, and in return, we shall be filled up with ecstasy: <span class=\\"e3\\">ānandāmbudhi-vardhanaṁ</span>. We shall feel that we are in the midst of an ocean of joy. At present, we are searching after a joyous feeling—like one who searches for a glass of water in the midst of the desert. But by dedication, we shall find that we are in an ocean of joy whose soothing sweetness is increasing at every moment."},{"class":"b69","text":" The quality of joy has variety, and it comes to help us in our serving attitude, so that at every moment we may feel new encouragement. So, we have to enquire from a proper agent, follow his advice, and try to understand how to improve our condition. At the same time, we should be conscious that the chance we have to render devotional service is rarely found. It is not very cheap. Therefore, we must utilise every minute, every second, every moment. We should be very much alert that a moment not be lost, that our attempt to dedicate ourselves may continue constantly without being interrupted. That stage of dedication is called niṣṭhā, and when we attain that stage, our taste is further improved, and we will be more and more encouraged to go forward and make progress towards ultimate fulfilment."},{"class":"b70","text":" Seven days to live"},{"class":"b50","text":" Śukadev Goswāmī told Parīkṣit Mahārāj that seven days of longevity is enough to achieve perfection. He said, “You have only seven days left to live; do you think it is a short time? It is enough time. What is all-important is the proper use of every second.” What time we have in our hands is uncertain, but we must try our best to properly use every second. This must not be neglected. We should not think, “The future is before me; any time I like, I can engage in the profitable affair of spiritual life.” Not one second should be lost.

We don’t know about our future. We must try to use the time at hand to its best advantage. And how will our time be best used? In the association of saints and scriptures. Purity is to be measured by the unit of sacrifice. And not sacrifice to any partial interest, but sacrifice to the whole. The Absolute Whole has been shown to us as the emporium of rasa (<span class=\\"e3\\">Akhila-rasāmṛta-mūrti</span>)—the Absolute Good, the Autocrat, the Designer and Destiner of everything we see. Our ideal of sacrifice should be so high that we can give up even the corresponding results of sacrifice. Self-abnegation, or self-surrender, is generally known as <span class=\\"e3\\">ātma-nivedanam</span>. However, <span class=\\"e3\\">ātma-nikṣepa</span> is a stronger word for surrender. It means “to throw oneself desperately towards the Infinite”. One must be desperate in self-sacrifice. In self-sacrifice, we must be very careful not to aspire for any greater or extended selfishness, but to surrender only to the Centre. Sacrifice is meant for the Centre—Kṛṣṇa—the all-attractor. In realising that position, we are concerned about two things—transcendental knowledge (sambandha) and the means for reaching the goal (abhidheya). If we realise these correctly, then the fulfilment of the ultimate goal (prayojan) will come automatically. We shall be very conscious about the Centre to whom we are dedicating everything. The object of our fulfilment (sambandha) and our dedication or purity of purpose (abhidheya), these two things are most important. This can be understood from the scriptures and the saints. And if we concern ourselves with the purest end and highest sacrifice, the end will come of itself. We are not to bother for any remuneration. We have only to do our duty, and the remuneration will come. To whom we will dedicate ourselves and what we shall receive—these things should be discussed, thought out, meditated upon, and put into practice. In this way, we must try to live in the infinite. We must always stay engaged in the cultivation of infinite love and infinite beauty as recommended by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b70","text":" Ocean of faith"},{"class":"b43","text":" Although the object of our heart’s faith is infinite, still, some conceptions of Him have been given by the men of experience in the ocean of faith.

It can guide us and be affectionate to us. All these things are to be reckoned with. He can guide us.

To get a visa to the world of reality we must recognise this."},{"class":"b69","text":" And this is especially true in Goloka, where complete surrender is demanded. In Vaikuṇṭha, there is some consideration of justice; for those who are entering there, some sort of lenience is given. But Goloka is very tight. Complete surrender is demanded in that place. Otherwise, the atmosphere there is very free. After one has been tested and the superiors are satisfied that the souls who have come there are wholly sacrificed, then we gain their confidence.

If we enquire deeply into where Yaśodā is taking her stand, we will come to the “die to live” plane. Yaśodā can embrace death millions of times to remove a bead of sweat from the brow of her son; she has so much affection for Kṛṣṇa that she is ready to die a million times rather than find the sweat of labour on His forehead. And that consciousness is in the background of everything she does. This is why she is given so much independence as to be able to whip Him. Such is the play of the Absolute."},{"class":"b44","text":" If we have an idea of the infinite broadness and depth of the Absolute, how can we value anything here? The Himalayas may be very big according to our standard, but from the standard of the infinite, the Himalayas are so small that they can’t even be seen. This world is all relative. We must not allow ourselves to be cowed down by any events here. We must go forward in our march towards the truth. We may fail anytime, anywhere; it does not matter. It may be our master’s will. Still, we have no other alternative than to try for His mercy, His grace."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is our natural position.

But actually it is as in play: so many parties are playing—one must win, another must be defeated—but we are told that we must accept victory or defeat in the mood of a player. And everything is the play of Kṛṣṇa. He is playing His līlā. When we think that something is a great loss or gain, we are not seeing the līlā of the Lord. Then, we are outside the divine flow; we are not in harmony with the flow of līlā. Then, it appears that reality is not His līlā, and we find some other reason for being, see some other objects, conceive of relative interests, and find loss and gain, victory and defeat, and so many other misconceptions. But everything is His līlā, and that is nirguṇa, without fault. In that plane, everything is all right. Everything is perfect.

It is <span class=\\"e3\\">ahaituky apratihatā</span>: it is causeless and it cannot be checked—it is irresistible.

And this should be noted very carefully. She knows that they cannot give proper satisfaction to Kṛṣṇa, so She cannot appreciate their trying to take Her place. That is Her contention.

The other attendants said, “We tried to stop her, but she would not hear of it. She wants to meet you.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The mistress replied, “All right.

It is my concern as his devout wife that he should be satisfied, and this is his aspiration. So, I want to see him happy.” Then, the prostitute understood everything and said, “Yes. Bring him tomorrow. I invite both of you to dine in my house.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" This was intimated to the brāhmaṇ and the following day they came. Many dishes were prepared fitting the occasion. Two entrees were served. One was prasādam on a plantain leaf accompanied by Ganges water in an earthen pot—all pure vegetarian food. Side by side with that in gold and silver pots were so many meats and rich dishes. They were served with a very nice table arrangement and sitting places. Of the two kinds of foodstuffs, one was sāttvik, pure, and the other was rājasik, filled with passion. Then, with folded palms, the prostitute invited the brāhmaṇ and his wife and indicated, “This is Bhāgavat-prasādam, and those are rich dishes prepared with meat. Whichever you like you may take at your sweet will.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Immediately the leper brāhmaṇ chose the prasādam, and began to take his meal.

I am so low, and your wife is the purest of the pure. Your real taste is for this sāttvik prasādam. Externally, the meat is very gorgeous, but internally it is very impure, filthy.

I am completely ready to serve them if they can really satisfy Kṛṣṇa. But they can’t. Yet still they have some demand. But I differ on that point.

And the path to self-improvement is also similar: we must learn to critique ourselves and appreciate the environment. Our appreciation should especially be for Kṛṣṇa and His devotees, and then gradually everyone else. He has not given anyone the authority to harm us. If it appears that way, it is only superficial and misleading. That anyone can do harm to anyone else is misleading. It is only true on the superficial plane. Of course, this does not condone harming others or ignoring oppression, but from the absolute standpoint there is no harm.

God consciousness means Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are consciousness, and we are meant for Kṛṣṇa consciousness—that is our relationship. We should always be conscious of this fact. We are connected with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are members of the Kṛṣṇa conscious world. And we have come to wander in the foreign land of material consciousness, māyik misconception, thinking that we are units of this material world, but it is not so."},{"class":"b44","text":" We are units of the conscious world—the Kṛṣṇa conscious world—and somehow we have come within this material conception of existence, the world of matter. Matter is what we can exploit, the objective side of reality, and the subjective side is the element we should revere. Our relationship with the subjective is that of reverence and devotion to the higher entity, and not that of exploitation or enjoyment. Real enjoyment, divine enjoyment, comes from service—not from exploitation."},{"class":"b69","text":" We must understand all these basic principles. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj once remarked to me that although the engineers in New York have built so many skyscraper buildings that will stand for ages, they were never mindful of how long their own bodies would last. The buildings will stand for a long, long time. But those who will live in those buildings have forgotten how long their bodies will stand. In this way, people are very busy on the objective side, but they are neglecting the subjective values. Their concern is with objects and not with who will use them. They think that no subjective cultivation is necessary for the user of the objective world. In this way, they give all importance to the objective side, neglecting totally the subjective side."},{"class":"b70","text":" Consciousness rays"},{"class":"b43","text":" Our real position is like the rays of the sun. A sun ray touches the earth. Where is its home? A sun ray comes to our plane and touches the hills and the water, but what should be considered as its home? Necessarily the sun, and not the earth it touches. Our position is similar. As rays of consciousness, we pertain not to the material world, but to the conscious world. Our home connection is there: in the sun—the spiritual sun."},{"class":"b44","text":" We are advised by the Vedas to consider: “Although you have been cast in a hole of this earth, still your native soil is the conscious sun. You emanate from there, you are sustained from there, and your prospect is there. You have to conceive of reality in that way. Because you are conscious, your home is the source of consciousness. Whether you are bird or beast, whether you are in the mountains, earth, or water—wherever you are, whatever position you hold—your source is in consciousness, existence. Your source is in consciousness just as the rays of light have their home in the sun.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The Vedas tell us: “You are not a child of this soil. You may be a captive here, but this is not your home; this is a foreign land. All your hopes and prospects can be supplied from that higher soil, because your nature is of that order. Your food, your sustenance, your every thing should be made of that higher stuff. But what is found within this material world is all poison to you.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Again, although what is pertaining to consciousness is the immediate, nearest realisation of our nature, if we are to go deeper into the conscious world, we shall find something more substantial. If we cross beyond the vision of light-consciousness, we shall find the real necessity of our existence: happiness—ecstasy—and divine love. After establishing ourselves in the realm of consciousness, we must establish ourselves in the realm of divine love, ecstasy, and beauty. We must search for our fortune there and never in this material world. Ecstasy is above light; transcendental mellow is above consciousness. Beauty and charm are above mere consciousness and understanding. Feeling is not complete in itself. Feeling must be for something. So, the fullest conception of a perfect thing is something which is full in beauty or ecstasy. Mere existence or consciousness alone cannot be the highest perfection. Ecstasy is the most perfect thing. Ecstasy, divine love, and beauty presuppose consciousness and existence."},{"class":"b44","text":" Spiritual reality is composed of three substances: sat, existence, chit, consciousness, and ānanda, ecstasy. And of these three, ānanda or ecstasy is the final conception of spiritual substance. Ecstasy can exist by itself. Neither existence nor consciousness is complete in themselves. Consciousness alone hankers for ecstasy. And existence without consciousness is to exist with no purpose. But when existence is endowed with consciousness, it can search for its own good: ecstasy. Ecstasy is an independent and concrete substance. Both existence and consciousness are subservient to ecstasy."},{"class":"b69","text":" And one who realises the ecstasy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness becomes free from this mortal world. When one realises that, he need not be afraid of anything. He need have no apprehension from any fear that can arise here in this material world where there is the constant threat of nonexistence. Here in the material world, we not only have no fulfilment, but our very existence is also at stake. At any moment, we may be devoured by nonexistence."},{"class":"b70","text":" Dive deep into reality"},{"class":"b43","text":" But to come to the plane of ecstasy, we shall have to dive deep into reality. We must not be satisfied with the formal, the superficial. If we concentrate our attention on the outward form of a thing, neglecting its inner substance, then we shall find that we are looking in the wrong place. When Mahāprabhu would look at the Deity of Jagannāthdev, apparently it seemed that His aim was fixed on the same thing we see when we look at the Deity. To our vision, however, the Deity of Jagannāth is only a doll made of wood. And yet when Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu would fix His eye there, He would shed tears of joy, and His tears flowed in an incessant current. Where is His vision of reality connected? What we see as a wooden doll, He sees in a completely different way. And just by looking at that, an incessant current of tears pours from His eyes. Where is His connection with reality located? He is viewing things from the opposite side, from the subjective world."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, how should we approach the Deity? When we have a look at the Deity, what should be our attitude? The Deity form of the Lord is not a mundane thing, and so we should learn the proper way in which to see the Deity. And more than this, we must try to look at this from the other point of view. As we are trying to see the Deity, He sees us. He has come down to help the fallen souls in this material world, and He has come down in such a way as to take us up to His domain."},{"class":"b44","text":" Rāmānuja has classified the expression of the Supreme Entity in five forms: <span class=\\"e3\\">Para</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Vyūha</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Vaibhava</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Antāryamī</span>, and <span class=\\"e3\\">Archā</span>. <span class=\\"e3\\">Para</span>, the central conception of the highest entity; <span class=\\"e3\\">Vyūha</span>, His extended self in different functions, in different figures; <span class=\\"e3\\">Vaibhava</span>, His appearance in this mundane plane as Avatārs like Matsya, Kūrma, and Varāha; <span class=\\"e3\\">Antaryāmī</span>, His presence in every heart and every soul, every conscious unit; and <span class=\\"e3\\">Archā</span>, His appearance in the plane of our physical perception as the Deity. In His form as the Deity, I can touch Him, I can see Him, and I can serve Him. In a concrete form, He has come to help our understanding."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu looked at the Deity, and His eyes were flooded with tears. It is not that His eyes were fixed upon the superficial characteristics of wood when He saw the Deity form of Lord Jagannāth, but He was connected on a vastly higher level with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. His thoughts were deep with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu thought, “Lord Jagannāth has come here and is making arrangements to deliver millions of fallen souls, especially by extending His own prasādam to one and all in great magnitude. His magnanimous presence has manifested here for the relief of this world.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" And Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest relief work. Our Guru Mahārāj used to say that there is a famine of Kṛṣṇa-kathā. There is a famine at present. But is the world suffering from a lack of food? No. The world is suffering from the famine of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Kṛṣṇa talk, Kṛṣṇa-kīrtan. So, we must try to open offices of food distribution so that we may distribute the food of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all souls. Mahāprabhu said, “Whoever you come across, talk of Kṛṣṇa (<span class=\\"e3\\">yāre dekha, tāre kaha ‘Kṛṣṇa’-upadeśa</span>).” Give them the food of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Kṛṣṇa-kathā. The world is filled with famine-stricken people. We must distribute food, give the life and breath of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to whomever we meet by speaking about Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" That was the feeling of Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī, and Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj carried that out in the West. Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta used to say, “I do not admit any other conception of famine. The only famine is that of Kṛṣṇa-kathā, Kṛṣṇa-smṛti, Kṛṣṇa consciousness.” With such seriousness, he conceived of our necessity for Kṛṣṇa consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa is of vital importance to our existence. Only Kṛṣṇa can give us vitality. And as Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, Kṛṣṇa Himself distributes Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Vāsudev Ghoṣa says, therefore, “Śrī Gaurāṅga is my life and soul, my only vitality. If Gaurāṅga had not come, how could I live? (<span class=\\"e3\\">yadi Gaura nā hata tabe ki ha-ita kemane dharitām de</span>) By His grace I have tasted such valuable food that without this, my life would be completely impossible.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the vitality of vitality. Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād did his best to give Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the people of India, and Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj distributed that vitality all over the world. It is by their grace and by the grace of Chaitanya Mahāprabhu Himself that so many have come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Haridās Ṭhākur once told Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, “By Your chanting of the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa, both the animate and inanimate world has been supplied with the food of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Whatever position they may occupy, their life is fulfilled. I heard of how, when You traveled through the jungle and chanted and danced, the elephants and tigers also danced and chanted the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa. What wonder, then, should there be if I say that the stones and trees have also attained their highest end—Kṛṣṇa consciousness—when You are chanting. What an intense degree of Kṛṣṇa consciousness has been produced here by Your chanting!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" But in order to chant the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa, something is required from our side also. <span class=\\"e3\\">Amāninā mānadena kīrtanīyaḥ sadā Hariḥ</span>. We should resort to kīrtan always, but our attitude should be as Mahāprabhu recommends: <span class=\\"e3\\">tṛṇād api sunīchena taror api sahiṣṇunā amāninā mānadena</span>. Our attitude should be one of humility, and if we think that we are being done wrong, still we should be patient, and under no circumstances should we work for our own position and prestige; that should not be our aim."},{"class":"b44","text":" When the lower stands against the higher, offence arises. That tendency should be shunned. Primary education is also education, but that should not compete with higher education; we must be careful about that. At the same time, the differentiation between higher education and lower education must be genuine. Still, primary education must not be thought of as the highest education. That will be dangerous. There is a saying in Bengali, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Alpa vidyā bhayaṅkarī</span>: a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.” We must be careful about that; otherwise, our attitude will be suicidal. The question of offence arises whenever primary education stands against higher education. That sort of assertion is offensive."},{"class":"b44","text":" Slow and steady wins the race. Our march towards the Infinite is a long journey, not a journey to be finished within a few hours, a few days, or a few years. And we have to adjust accordingly. It is not that we shall run quickly to make progress and then stop and sleep. It is a long way we shall have to go. We will only be successful if we develop humility—<span class=\\"e3\\">tṛṇād api sunīchena</span>. We should not create any circumstance that invites resistance. Still, if any resistance unexpectedly approaches us, we should try our best to forbear. And we must always be conscious that our guardian’s eye is always over us, eager to help us in our campaign. We are not alone. We may go on confidently: there is a person above us to redress the wrong that may be shown to us, so we should not take the initiative."},{"class":"b44","text":" We must not allow any ulterior purpose or temptation to induce us to give up our search for Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Let the satisfaction of Guru, Gaurāṅga, Kṛṣṇa, and the Vaiṣṇavas be our only objective. Let no other element enter upon our path. Our purity of purpose must always be very scrupulously maintained. We should think, “Alone I shall go on with my duty. I won’t be always searching for someone to come and help me. Let them do their own duty. This is my duty.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" With this attitude we shall go on. With this sort of adjustment our concentration may become more intense, our confidence in Kṛṣṇa will be increased, and our duty will be pure and clear.

So this life is not a life of comfort."},{"class":"b70","text":" Holy feet of Viṣṇu"},{"class":"b43","text":" But in order to develop this kind of humility and forbearance, we must learn to see the Lord’s hand in everything.

Why the sun? The sun is described as <span class=\\"e3\\">pradarśaka</span>: the seer, the witness. Apparently we see the sun, but really the sun helps us to see. The holy feet of Viṣṇu means the lowest part of Viṣṇu—<span class=\\"e3\\">deha-dehi-vibhāgo ’yaṁ neśvare vidyate kvachit</span>. His lower part to us is the beginning of realisation for us. The beginning of realisation is to think that God is always seeing us. As the sun helps us to see, Viṣṇu’s holy feet are like the sun. So, we should try to always see everything by the rays of the holy feet of Viṣṇu."},{"class":"b44","text":" From another point of view, His holy feet are like a big eye spread over the sky. He sees everything. Whatever we do, our guardian’s vigilant eye is over our head like the sun. Before we enter into any action we must remember this Vedic mantra. The <span class=\\"e3\\">Ṛg-veda</span> is the first Veda, and this is the most important mantra of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Ṛg-veda</span>. The brāhmaṇs of the Vedic school are told that whenever they do any service pertaining to religion or varṇāśram, they must first remember this <span class=\\"e3\\">Ṛg-veda</span> mantra: “Viṣṇu’s feet are over you, and they are looking at you like a guardian’s vigilant eye. Always remembering this, do your duty.”"},{"class":"b52","text":" If you always remember that He is seeing everything you do, you can’t do anything wrong. You won’t be able to venture to do anything offensive to the Lord as long as you remember that through everything, the searching eye, the all-knowing, omniscient eye, of the Lord is always watching over you. This remembrance cannot but purify your heart and understanding and the whole of your mental system, and help you to approach Divinity in the right way. It is not that you can do anything and everything without His knowing; not that you are the master wire-puller of both your own life and of the world; not that you are going to exert your mastery, your influence over the environment in a selfish attempt. Always remember that one big eye is spread over your head seeing everything like the searching light of a strong x-ray. What even you do not know about yourself, He knows. What is underground in the innermost subconscious region of your heart, He can also see. If you remember this as you move and live, you cannot but be purified. Just as cancer can be removed from the body by a laser ray, the whole disease of material existence will vanish from our hearts by this purifying influence of the divine rays of light from the holy feet of Viṣṇu."}]},{"title":"Lord of The Cows","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b47","text":" Lord of The Cows"},{"class":"b53","text":" deve varṣati yajña-viplava-ruṣā vajrāśma-varṣānilaiḥ<br />sīdat-pāla-paśu-stri ātma-śaraṇaṁ dṛṣṭvānukampy utsmayam<br />utpāṭyaika-kareṇa śailam abalo līlochchhilīndhraṁ yathā<br />bibhrad goṣṭham apān mahendra-mada-bhit prīyān na indro gavām"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad Bhāgavatam: 10.26.25)"},{"class":"b43","text":" The very gist of the Govardhan-līlā, the very substance of the Pastime, is represented in this verse.

And I am a little accustomed to His ways and manners. But this boy is not Nārāyaṇ. That anything can exist above Nārāyaṇ is impossible. Then, who is He?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" To test Kṛṣṇa, Brahmā took away the cowherd boys and calves accompanying Him and hid them in a cave. After a year, he returned to see how life was continuing in Vṛndāvan, to see how Kṛṣṇa was doing without His calves and cowherd boys. And he found that everything was as before. The Lord, surrounded by His cowherd boyfriends, was carrying His flute under His armpit and a morsel of food in His hand. He found everything going on as it had been."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, Brahmā began to think, “What is this? Have the calves and cowherd boys come back without my notice?” He again checked the cave where he had hid them and found that they were all there. Then, he thought, “How is this possible? I stole the calves and cowherd boys and hid them here, and now that I have returned, I find they are all still here just as before.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Finally, perplexed, he fell at Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, praying, “My Lord, I could not recognise You. You have come to play such a plain and ordinary part, that of a cowherd boy. How can anyone believe that You hold an even greater position than that of Nārāyaṇ? Please forgive whatever I have done.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In many places in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, we find Lord Brahmā, the creator of the universe, being tested by Kṛṣṇa. And still, Brahmā is our Gurudev. He is the original Guru of our line. That he could become bewildered is so perplexing and difficult to understand that Madhva Āchārya eliminated that section from the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>."},{"class":"b69","text":" He could not accept those two chapters of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> where Brahmā was under illusion, where he had some misunderstanding about Kṛṣṇa. But Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu accepted everything in total. This is a very peculiar thing. How can the original Guru of our sampradāya become bewildered about Kṛṣṇa? It is achintya, inconceivable. Still, everything is intelligible through the philosophy of achintya-bhedābheda-tattva, “inconceivable oneness and difference”. How can we accommodate that our original Guru becomes perplexed, not only once, but twice? That is līlā, a divine Pastime. An example of achintya-bhedābheda-tattva is found in the way Kṛṣṇa deals with His devotees. Kṛṣṇa Himself is independent of everything. Still, sometimes He shows Himself to be completely subordinate to His servants and must do whatever they want Him to. Then again, sometimes He completely ignores them. These are the spontaneous Pastimes of the Sweet Absolute. Sometimes He shows absolute submission to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, and again, sometimes He ignores Her. This is the very nature of Kṛṣṇa’s līlā."},{"class":"b70","text":" Crooked Pastimes"},{"class":"b43","text":" Rūpa Goswāmī has supplied a verse from his <span class=\\"e3\\">Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi </span>as the basis of the proper understanding of Kṛṣṇa-līlā. When we think about the Pastimes of the Absolute, we, the finite, will have to wear this armour: <span class=\\"e3\\">aher iva gatiḥ premṇaḥ svabhāva-kuṭilā bhavet</span>. We must understand that Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes are naturally crooked, just like the movement of a snake. A snake cannot move in a straight line; he moves in a zig-zag way. The waves that flow from the Absolute move in the same way. That characteristic of Kṛṣṇa-līlā is always maintained above everything else. Kṛṣṇa can never be ruled by any law. With this initial consideration we should approach any study of the Absolute. We must always keep in mind that He is absolute, and we are infinitesimal. He is adhokṣaja, transcendental, beyond the world of our experience."},{"class":"b44","text":" Once, I asked our Prabhupād, “Why is there a difference between Sanātan and Rūpa in their conception of the final part of Kṛṣṇa-līlā? Sanātan closed his summary of Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes in his <span class=\\"e3\\">Kṛṣṇa-līlā-stava</span> in Mathurā, and Rūpa took it another step towards Dvārakā in his <span class=\\"e3\\">Lalita-mādhava</span>. He wrote two plays dealing with Kṛṣṇa-līlā: one about Dvārakā and one about Vṛndāvan. <span class=\\"e3\\">Vidagdha-mādhava</span> takes place in Vṛndāvan; <span class=\\"e3\\">Lalita-mādhava</span> takes place in Dvārakā. But Sanātan Goswāmī liked to complete Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes in Mathurā."},{"class":"b44","text":" According to Sanātan Goswāmī, after a long separation between Kṛṣṇa and His family and friends, like a wheel, the Pastime moves from Mathurā again to Vṛndāvan. After Kṛṣṇa has gone to Mathurā, the residents of Vṛndāvan, overwhelmed by separation, begin to think, “Kṛṣṇa has been gone for such a long time. Nanda and Yaśodā have lost their child!” The separation intensifies and develops further until they begin to think, “Oh, Nanda and Yaśodā have no child!” Then, they think, “They must have a child”, and begin to pray for the appearance of Kṛṣṇa. Then, Kṛṣṇa appears as the son of Nanda and Yaśodā. The cycle is complete and everyone is happy thinking, “Oh yes, Yaśodā has got a child.” In this way, Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes again begin developing in Vṛndāvan and move to Mathurā, where He kills Kaṁsa."},{"class":"b69","text":" In his <span class=\\"e3\\">Kṛṣṇa-līlā-stava</span>, his summary of Kṛṣṇa-līlā, Sanātan Goswāmī did not take Kṛṣṇa into Dvārakā from Mathurā Maṇḍal. But Rūpa Goswāmī, in his play <span class=\\"e3\\">Lalita-mādhava</span>, showed the parallels between Kṛṣṇa-līlā in Vṛndāvan and Kṛṣṇa-līlā in Dvārakā. And so, in his <span class=\\"e3\\">Lalita-mādhava</span>, Rūpa Goswāmī draws a parallel between Lalitā as Jāmbavatī, Rādhārāṇī as Satyabhāmā, and Chandrāvalī as Rukmiṇī.

He simply said, “It is adhokṣaja, beyond our understanding.” So, Kṛṣṇa-līlā is “ununderstandable” (achintya). Everything is not bound to come within our fist. The Supreme Lord has “All Rights Reserved”. This must be understood if we at all want to be in connection with that plane of reality."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> says <span class=\\"e3\\">jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva</span>: it is a defect to want to understand everything about Divinity.

We want to have the key to everything in our possession. But this is really a bar to progress. If we assert ourselves in this way, we rather lose what confidence we might have in Divinity, and there will be some delay in extending the key to us. If a servant, upon getting employment in the master’s house, is very eager to be entrusted with the house keys, then the master will suspect him. So, to want to know everything is a type of disease; it is an enemy to our progress."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is, of course, difficult to accept. But still, it is true. Surrender is everything. What cultivation of knowledge do we find in the gopīs—the most exalted devotees of Kṛṣṇa? What was their acquaintance with scripture? Nothing."},{"class":"b69","text":" What we understand to be “standard purity”, what we think to be knowledge—all these things are disqualifications in giving pleasure to the Absolute. An example of how our misconceived standards of “purity” and “chastity” are a disqualification can be seen in the following story."},{"class":"b70","text":" A mystic physician"},{"class":"b43","text":" In order to prove the supreme position of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, one day, Kṛṣṇa appeared to suddenly fall ill. As He lay sick, He came in another form, disguised as a physician, and said: “O Yaśodā, I have heard that your boy has caught some disease. Is it true?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “Yes, yes, who are you?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “I am a physician—a mystic physician. I would like to see your son.

I want to cure Him. But I can only do so if I can have some water brought in a porous pot. Some water should be brought from the Yāmuna in a pot that has many holes in it. Only a chaste lady can do this. A chaste girl must bring some water in a porous pot. With the help of that I shall give some medicine to this boy, and He will come to consciousness immediately.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, Yaśodā madly began to search Vṛndāvan for a chaste lady. Jaṭilā and Kuṭilā were Rādhārāṇī’s mother-in-law and sister-in-law. Because they naturally preached that there was doubt or suspicion about the chastity of the other girls among the gopīs, they themselves were generally considered to be chaste. So, Yaśodā appealed to one of them, Jaṭilā, first. “Take this porous pot and fetch some water from the Yāmuna.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “How is it possible? To fetch water in a porous pot is impossible.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “No. The physician says that if one is really a chaste lady, then she can fetch water in a porous pot.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Jaṭilā could not avoid the mad request of Yaśodā. Her request was so intense that she had to go. But she could not fetch water from the Yāmuna because there were so many holes in the pot. Then Kuṭilā was requested to fetch water in the pot, but she dared not venture to try it, seeing the attempt of her mother. Still, Yaśodā was so earnest in her request that Kuṭilā also could not avoid the task. Yaśodā couldn’t tolerate for a second that her son was in such a condition. And so her request was so intense that Kuṭilā had to go. But she could not fetch water either because there were so many holes in the waterpot that the water just poured through."},{"class":"b44","text":" They were astonished, thinking, “What can we do? Among all the girls in Vraja, not a single chaste girl is to be found? What a horrible thing!” So, Kṛṣṇa, in the garb of a physician, singled out Rādhārāṇī, saying: “I think that She is a chaste lady. Request Her to fetch the water.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" And at the request of Yaśodā, Rādhārāṇī could not avoid the task. She had to go fetch water, but She was thinking of Kṛṣṇa: “If You come to My relief, then only it may be possible; otherwise, it is impossible”, She prayed. Rādhārāṇī dipped the porous pot in the water as Kṛṣṇa touched the pot from within the water. And Rādhārāṇī with great suspicion took the pot from the water, and in great wonder She said, “The water is there!” She had taken some of Her maids, the sakhīs, Her chief friends, with Her, and they were all astounded to find that She drew the water from the Yamunā. The holes were there, but still the water remained within the pot. So, She brought the water to Yaśodā, and everyone was astounded. And that water with some fictitious medicine was given to the boy Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa arose from His “unconscious” state."},{"class":"b44","text":" This was a tactic by Kṛṣṇa to show the position of Rādhārāṇī, to show what chastity is. What is chastity? Ordinary “chastity” is not real chastity. Real purity, real chastity, is far above all relative considerations of chastity. And that is inconceivable, beyond our knowledge and reason, just as how a porous pot can contain water. It is a miracle."},{"class":"b44","text":" But God works wonders. His ways are filled with miracles. We should be prepared for that. We should be prepared that all the knowledge of this world, all our experience, will prove to be wrong. So it is said, <span class=\\"e3\\">jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva</span>: be clear of your past experiences, what you have drawn from the world of the senses, empirical knowledge (pratyakṣa-jñān). Your tendency will always be to try to push your way into the transcendental world on the strength of mundane knowledge. But this verse is saying, “You fallen people, your capital is the experience of this world, of the senses. But it won’t do, it won’t have any value in that higher plane. What is found there is a new thing, so approach that world with an open mind; understand that everything is possible with the infinite. All your expectations, your past experience, have no value. Why don’t you give up trying to dodge this point?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The transcendental world is something quite new to us. It is very difficult to get out of this superstition of so-called “truth” here. But still it is necessary that we accept that anything and everything is possible with God. He is the master of impossibilities. Possibility and impossibility are found only in our dictionary, yet even Napoleon wanted to remove the word “impossible”. He said, “’Impossible’ is a word in a fool’s dictionary.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" How are we to understand that the original Guru of our sampradāya becomes bewildered? It is “impossible”. We must suspend our “knowledge” (<span class=\\"e3\\">jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva</span>). We may take it that Kṛṣṇa is playing hide and seek, perhaps, with Brahmā, our Gurudev. It is like a game of hide and seek. Sometimes Kṛṣṇa is defeating others, and sometimes He is defeated."},{"class":"b70","text":" Kṛṣṇa and Balarām"},{"class":"b43","text":" When Kṛṣṇa and Balarām are playing with Their friends in the jungle, They generally play in two groups. Kṛṣṇa is in one group, and Balarām is in another. Kṛṣṇa is considered to be less strong than Balarām. Balarām was the strongest person there, and the next strongest was Śrīdāmā, so Śrīdāmā used to play on the side of Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" Whenever Balarām was defeated, He would become enraged. Kṛṣṇa would diplomatically help His own team, and when Balarām saw that His own team was disloyal due to Kṛṣṇa’s tricks, He would turn to His younger brother Kṛṣṇa and say, “I shall punish You!” But Kṛṣṇa would say, “No, You cannot punish Me; Mother Yaśodā has entrusted Me in Your care. You can’t mistreat Me.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" One day, Balarām slapped Kṛṣṇa, but Kṛṣṇa went to Mother Yaśodā and told on Him. Balarām was very disturbed and said, “I slap You once, and You complain to Your mother that I do not love You? Kṛṣṇa, how could You do this?” At last, Kṛṣṇa was perplexed and accepted His defeat."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, Kṛṣṇa-līlā moves in a crooked way (<span class=\\"e3\\">aher iva gatiḥ premṇaḥ</span>…). This fundamental point, the foundation of our understanding about Kṛṣṇa-līlā, has been given by Rūpa Goswāmī in this verse. He says, “Don’t be eager to find reason everywhere in the Pastimes of Divinity. They are naturally crooked. In Kṛṣṇa-līlā, we shall find that although no party is defective, still, one will find fault with another and begin a quarrel. No defect can be found there. But still, for the necessity of līlā, false defects are found, and some quarrel begins. This is the meaning of līlā, Pastimes: what we find here by necessity flows there automatically. We can’t try to apply our reason or our standard of measurement to the movements of the Infinite. And whatever gain we have made by connecting with that flow of līlā will be lost in our attempts to measure it; that will be the only consequence of our analysis. So, we should try to have a taste of līlā with a submissive attitude. Sometimes reason, logic, and analysis are necessary, but only to preach to the people in general who have a lower understanding. Only for the purpose of preaching to people addicted to reason do we have to take the help of reason. But when devotion becomes automatic, anurāga, then both reason and scripture are left in the subterranean position. There is no place for scriptural arguments there. To a certain extent, reason is necessary for our development up to vaidhī-bhakti, the elementary stages of devotion. But above that, it has no use."},{"class":"b44","text":" Anurāga-bhajan is automatic; that is the nature of līlā: <span class=\\"e3\\">aher iva gatiḥ premṇaḥ</span>. Everything there moves by His sweet will. Sweet will means that it is not a fixed program. It moves in such a way that we can’t say, “It will pass by this road.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" When the Mahārāj of Mysore used to drive into town, he would not speak to his driver, giving him directions which way to go, because if any fixed program were arranged, then his life might be in danger. So, whenever he would come to a crossing in the road, he would touch his stick to a particular shoulder of the driver. If at the crossing, the Mahārāj wanted to go to the right, he would touch the driver on his right shoulder. In this way, he would never disclose which way he would go, but only at the last moment he would beckon the driver to take a particular course."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, Kṛṣṇa’s divine movements are kept in reserve by His sweet will: “All Rights Reserved”. We want to search for some law above His sweet will, but this is inconsistent. It is self-contradictory. On the one side, we say that Kṛṣṇa moves by His own sweet will, but on another side, we try to find some law governing His movement. This is a contradiction. Līlā moves by sweet will. When we say it is līlā, then we can’t give any shape to that. We can say that it was shown in a particular place in a particular way. But we cannot be sure whether today the same course will be taken."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is why we find differences in the explanations given about different līlās in different ages. Jīva Goswāmī has explained that the reason for different descriptions of the Pastimes of the Lord in the Purāṇas is because at one time that līlā was played in one way, and another time it was played in another way. So, we find differences even in the explanations of the same Pastime."},{"class":"b69","text":" Scholars may challenge: “Why is it that somewhere in <span class=\\"e3\\">Padma-purāṇa</span> the līlā is mentioned in this way, but the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat-purāṇa </span>reveals the description in another way? Why does <span class=\\"e3\\">Hari-vaṁśa</span> differ from <span class=\\"e3\\">Mahābhārata</span>?” We say that in different kalpas, or ages, the Pastimes are enacted in different ways. In infinite ways, a particular līlā of the Lord may be represented within this world, because He is infinite, independent, and absolute. So, leaving aside all doubts and suspicions, we shall be most generous in approaching the Absolute, free from all inhibitions. We shall approach Him with that spirit and try more and more to leave aside our past prejudices and precedents, the records of our past experience."},{"class":"b70","text":" Is God dead?"},{"class":"b43","text":" We shall approach Him remembering that He is still living. It is not a stereotyped thing. We should not expect only what was done once before. If we expect the same thing, it will only reassure us by its repetition that He is not a living thing, that Divinity is under historical law. Should we think that in the past He showed Himself in a particular way, so He is compelled to show Himself in that way always? Is He not living today? Can He not show anything new?"},{"class":"b44","text":" At every moment, every second, He can show everything in quite a new way. So, our heart should open wide when we approach the highest authority of the absolute plane of play. That means surrender must be increased to no limit. Surrender is limitless, and His play or līlā is also limitless. With that sort of deep vision, we shall try to read His līlā. So, although Brahmā and the other gods and gurus and the givers of many śāstras may have given some description of His Pastimes, we shall have to realise that Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes are not bound by their descriptions. Kṛṣṇa is not confined within a cage."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, for this reason, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu did not hesitate to give a description of the bewilderment of Brahmā (Brahma-vimohana-līlā). Brahmā was bewildered in Kṛṣṇa-līlā in Vṛndāvan, and again when Brahmā went to have an interview with Kṛṣṇa in Dvārakā, we find the same condition. The boundary of the sweet will of the Infinite is such that anything can be accommodated there, and even Lord Brahmā, the creator of the universe, can be perplexed by Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" All these Pastimes are like so many lighthouses showing us which way to go. Brahmā is our Guru, but he was bewildered by Kṛṣṇa. And Vedavyās, the universal Guru, was also chastised by Nārad. Nārad was put to the test many times. All these examples are showing us the way; they are pointing out the direction. It is said, <span class=\\"e3\\">śrutibhir vimṛgyām</span>: the authentic books about the revealed truth are only showing the way. They say, “Go in this direction. Where? We do not exactly know, but you may go in this direction.” They are only showing the direction. All the śrutis, the guidance given by the scholars of revealed truth, give some direction: “Go this way, in this direction, and perhaps you may find it.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Vedaiś cha sarvair Aham eva vedyo</span>: all the Vedas are intended to reveal Me, the Infinite.” They mean to show how the Infinite is moving. If I analyse one atom within my fist, I can analyse it again and again and reanalyse it to no end. It is already within my fist, and yet it is infinite. So, it has been said that we may get the maximum benefit by surrendering. Kṛṣṇa says, “Give up all your prejudices and the limitations drawn from the limited world and be open. Then it will be easy for the Infinite to cast different shades of light on your soul and your knowing faculty. And then it will be easy for you also to cleanse your plane of understanding, cleanse your glass, the mirror of your heart.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In connection with the Infinite you will find that everywhere there is centre, nowhere circumference. But to realise this, you must try to live in eternity, in Vaikuṇṭha. <span class=\\"e3\\">Kuṇṭha</span> means “measurement”. <span class=\\"e3\\">Vaikuṇṭha</span> means “no crookedness, no limit, no measure”. That is Vaikuṇṭha."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Kṛṣṇa opened His mouth, Yaśodā was astonished to find the entire universal creation. Yaśodā was nonplused. “What do I see? The whole universe? The infinite in the finite?” At that moment she almost fainted, but then her cat cried aloud. And Kṛṣṇa, as if He was very much afraid of the sound of the cat, caught hold of His mother out of fear. Then at once, Yaśodā’s apprehension disappeared. She thought, “Oh, no … He is my son! There is no representation of the infinite within Him; He is my son.” And she embraced Him."},{"class":"b51","text":" When Brahmā took away the cowherd boys and calves, he thought that he had created some want in the līlā, but he came to find it flowing just as it had been. Not even the least part of it had been disturbed. Kṛṣṇa had expanded Himself to become the calves and the cowherd boys. When Kṛṣṇa Himself took the form of all the calves and cowherd boys, then the mothers felt an infinite type of affection, so much so that they could not understand, but were rather entranced, thinking, “How beautiful these boys are!” And the cows were also mad to show their affection to those calves. Then, Brahmā thought, “Have those cowherd boys and calves that I have stolen come here stealthily to join Him?” Again he went to see where he had hidden them. He saw, “No, the boys and calves are where I kept them in the caves of the mountain. They are there!” Again he returned to where Kṛṣṇa was and saw everything continuing as it had been. At that time, Brahmā surrendered and was reassured. He spoke the following prayer:"},{"class":"b59","text":" naumīḍya te ‘bhra-vapuṣe taḍid-ambarāya<br />guñjāvataṁsa-paripichchha-lasan-mukhāya<br />vanya-sraje kavala-vetra-viṣāṇa-veṇu-<br />lakṣma-śriye mṛdu-pade paśupāṅgajāya"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad Bhāgavatam: 10.14.1)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “I offer my prayers unto You, O praiseworthy Lord, who is the child of the cowherd Nanda.

Your charming face is adorned with guñjā-mālā ornaments, and Your hair is decorated with a peacock feather. You look beautiful wearing a garland of forest flowers, and that beauty is enhanced by the morsel of food in Your left hand. You carry a buffalo horn and a stick for herding cows tucked beneath Your left arm. You hold a flute and other emblems, and Your feet are as soft as a lotus.” That is the general meaning of this verse. The internal meaning of this verse, however, is this: “O venerable one, we submit our prayers to You. Who are You? You are un-seeable, un-feelable, unknown, and unknowable. Your complexion is the colour of a black cloud, and therefore You are very difficult to see, but You can be seen because of Your yellow garb.” Yellow is Rādhārāṇī’s colour. So, only by the help of Kṛṣṇa’s potency can it be ascertained who He is. <span class=\\"e3\\">Taḍit</span> means lightning. By the help of lightning we can see a black cloud at night. So, although Kṛṣṇa is unknown and unknowable, His potency can reveal Him to us. Brahmā says, “You are the venerable entity I have come to know. Now I bow down to You. Your body is like that of a black cloud, and that is some mystic representation. Black generally cannot be detected. But Your dress of yellow colour helps us to know what You are. It is carrying some similarity to the yellow dress of Nārāyaṇ. Your black body and yellow dress hint towards the personification of Nārāyaṇ. You are unknown and unknowable Yourself.

You take a morsel of food in Your hand and run after cows. That is a sign of being low-class. The higher-caste people like brāhmaṇs and kṣatriyas cannot move like this or behave in such a way with their food. The instrument you carry—a bamboo flute—is also unsophisticated. And Your stride is short. All this is misleading us to have a lower conception of You. You are hiding Yourself, so how can we understand You?

It is difficult to accept that You, Kṛṣṇa, are the master of everything."},{"class":"b44","text":" “You have so many plain ornaments.

Although I am the creator and have created everything, I fail to understand this sort of creation. I am proud that I have created so many things in the world, but I am overwhelmed to see the beauty of the environment here in Vṛndāvan. Here Your movement is slow, but sure and beautiful. You may be the son of that human being who keeps the cows—this is not a very high status in society or in the scriptures—but it is the nature of Your personality that whatever You do, You make it hold the highest position. What is this! Whoever You may be, my vanity is defeated. I take refuge at Your holy feet—I surrender. Please help me to understand what You really are.” In this way, Brahmā surrendered. And so, Kṛṣṇa is beyond the understanding even of the creator of the universe. He is infinite. And He is infinite not only in the consideration of space, but also in the consideration of time.

The highest conception of the infinite is <span class=\\"e3\\">bhajanīya-guṇa-viśiṣṭa</span>: He is so beautiful and attractive that He is attracting all to surrender to Him. No other conception of the infinite, neither infinite space, nor time, nor anything else, can approach this highest conception of the infinite: the all-attractive infinite.

Everything can be ignored if we are in connection with love. The fulfilment of our existence, of all existence, of everything, is in love.

The very gist of existence is there; it can’t be ignored or challenged by any other forms or aspects of our substantial existence. It is unchallengeable and absolute."},{"class":"b44","text":" Whatever we may experience, the most central need for fulfilment remains: love. The absolute king of everything is love.

Equal treatment towards one and all did not satisfy Her. So, She decided to display a composition of singing and dancing to please Kṛṣṇa in a most wonderful transcendental way. Rādhārāṇī showed Her skill in various ways, and then at the last moment, She suddenly disappeared. And as Kṛṣṇa was engaged in that combined singing and dancing, He suddenly found that Rādhārāṇī was absent. So, He left everyone to search for Rādhārāṇī. He met Her on the way, and after walking for some time, Rādhārāṇī told Him, “I can’t move, I can’t walk anymore. If You would like to go on, You will have to carry Me. I cannot go further.” And suddenly, Kṛṣṇa disappeared."},{"class":"b44","text":" A disciple of Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur once asked him why Kṛṣṇa had disappeared in such a way. But our Guru Mahārāj was very disturbed to hear such a question. In this līlā, Kṛṣṇa is apparently showing some disregard for Rādhārāṇī. So, our Guru Mahārāj, by his very nature, could not even tolerate such a question. He had so much partiality towards Rādhārāṇī that he was not disposed to hear anything against Her. And so, in a rather excited mood, he answered, “Do you find any devotion here? What bhakti do you find here that you have asked me this question?” The question was rejected. He could not tolerate even an enquiry regarding that Pastime."},{"class":"b44","text":" When this news came to me, I tried to find what Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur had written in his own words about this verse of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> in his own translation, <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatārka-marīchi-mālā</span>. Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur has harmonised the difficulties in the verse. He explains that Kṛṣṇa was thinking, “I would like to see what will be the mentality of separation in Her.” Only to appreciate the depth of the separation She felt from Him did Kṛṣṇa disappear. Then of course, Kṛṣṇa returned after some time."},{"class":"b44","text":" But our Guru Mahārāj could not even tolerate the idea. “Where is devotion to be found here?” But Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur interpreted this Pastime to mean that Kṛṣṇa was driven to see what kind of happiness in separation Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī would experience. He took this as an example of how the Absolute becomes subservient to His devotee. And so we find that the negative, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, is so powerful that the positive, Kṛṣṇa, becomes powerless near Her. It is as if the positive loses its separate existence. This is the victory of devotion."},{"class":"b69","text":" Devotion is represented in the negative side, drawing from the positive. There is the juice in a fruit and the one who extracts the juice from the fruit. The highest devotion is found where the extraction is in its most intensified condition—there is the victory of the devotees: where the Absolute accepts defeat before His servitors. This reveals the real presence of devotion, dedication, surrender."},{"class":"b70","text":" Lord of love"},{"class":"b43","text":" Surrender is so powerful that it can even capture the Absolute. We are aspiring for that kind of potency. And whoever possesses that—they are all-in-all; they are our masters. For our highest interest, we must look towards the direction in which that power is intensified. We shall try to look wherever we find surrender in a thick, condensed stage. Our aim should be directed towards that. We are beggars of that. We are not beggars for anything which can be found in this mundane world: <span class=\\"e3\\">na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ</span>, not wealth, followers, or the enjoyment of women, but eliminating everything else, our aim should be directed towards one thing—that most intensified condition of divine service to the Lord of love."},{"class":"b44","text":" We should try to convert everything in such a way that it can go to that unknown quarter beyond the jurisdiction of our sense experience or mental acquisition, like a rocket sent towards deep space. <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, which draws the essence from all of the revealed scriptures, says that divine love is the most desirable and original thing. We must not allow ourselves to run here and there searching for base fulfilment. We must forcibly concentrate our attention on divine love. Divine love is the highest thing for us; it is the highest in creation, the highest in eternity."},{"class":"b44","text":" And to take our stand in the negative position is the strategy of remaining in the relativity of the highest quarter of service to Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur once composed a verse expressing the proper attitude, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Pūjala rāga-patha gaurava-bhaṅge mātala sādhu-jana viṣaya-raṅge</span>: the path of divine love is worshipable to us and should be held overhead as our highest aspiration.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He ordered that a cottage be built for him in Govardhan and said, “I shall live there.

So, I shall go and serve them there in Rādhā Kuṇḍa and then return to a little lower position, in Govardhan. There I shall stay.” That is the proper tactic to maintain a subjective position in the subjective world."},{"class":"b44","text":" Otherwise, if we think that we are in the highest quarter, that higher reality will vanish from us. Only from a little lower position shall we view that higher plane with respect. But whenever we think that we have attained that higher position, that we are there—we are nowhere. That is the nature of the higher world. So, we must maintain a respectable distance. If we try to look directly, we lose, but if we try to look at that plane through a screen or from a hidden place, then we may see. It is most peculiar. If we want to come in direct contact with things of a higher order, then they vanish from our experience. If you can’t come in direct connection with some thing, you may find out about it by espionage—it is something like espionage. If you try to know it directly, it is impossible. Only from behind a screen can we have a glimpse."},{"class":"b44","text":" In that way, we can experience the highest ontological truth. As if by chance ontological truth comes to us, He accepts us suddenly, and we can find Him. He is absolute, He is an autocrat, He is independent; whenever He comes by His own whim to give His connection to us, we can have it. It is never within my clutches. He is not an object to come directly within my control. He is always above."},{"class":"b44","text":" By this system we can come to the highest realisation. In the highest order of līlā of Rādhā-Govinda, Kṛṣṇa asks Rādhārāṇī to do something, and She refuses, saying “No, I won’t do that.” And yet this has been accepted as the highest mood of the negative side. To deny Kṛṣṇa whatever He may want is called vāmya-bhāva. And Rādhārāṇī is full of that nature. But that enhances the eagerness, the earnestness of Kṛṣṇa. The whole system is a crooked one. And yet this is the way recommended for the poorest to come in contact with the highest. It is a wonderful device. The direct transaction, the clear face-to-face transaction, is absent there. Everything is like stealing. Everything there is a stealthy performance. In the highest area, in the area of autocracy, it is wholly black marketeering. And for that reason it is known as aprākṛta—just similar to the lowest conception of things. In our present living condition, we can’t tolerate autocracy. It is considered the lowest thing. But autocracy is there in the highest world. So, it is known as aprākṛta: the highest quarter of the transcendental world which can harmonise everything."},{"class":"b44","text":" The beauty of that plane is that even what is considered to be of the lowest type here is all harmonised there. The harmonious strength is so great there that what is undesirable, nasty, and bad here is harmonised in such a way that it gets the highest position there. Kṛṣṇa’s peculiar position is such that the lowest has been proven to be the highest by His magical touch. Because He is there, no blot is a blot; it is pure. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the touch of Kṛṣṇa, the beauty of the highest order. Just as the touchstone will not only convert silver into gold, but it will also transform even iron, lead, or any lower thing into gold; the touchstone of Kṛṣṇa is so powerful that the lowest type of everything within our conception receives the highest position by His magical touch."},{"class":"b69","text":" Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī says that if you are unable to accept this as truth, then you will be thrown down into Vaikuṇṭha: “Go live there, where general law rules, where there are fair dealings.

Even Mahādev and Brahmā are both bewildered in understanding it. Baffled by Kṛṣṇa, Brahmā surrendered to Him and confessed, “How could I know that the highest truth was a cowherd boy with a rod under His armpit and a morsel of food in His hand, searching for His friends?” Brahmā said: “I have some intimacy with my father Nārāyaṇ; whenever any difficulty appears, I approach Him to get some instruction and then act accordingly. But I have never come in connection with any supreme power like this. A cowherd boy taking His food in one hand and a rod in the other, going off in search of His friends—He is the highest? It is inconceivable. But now I see that You are far above my father Nārāyaṇ. Vaikuṇṭha is a fair and lawful field we know. But we have never experienced such Pastimes of tactful and obscure diplomacy. That this sort of thing is going on in the highest quarter, we should not be blamed for being unaware of that. It is wonderful and hidden, obscure. And yet there is a plane where so much wealth and sweetness are unknown to us.” Thomas Gray once wrote:"},{"class":"b99","text":" Full many a gem of purest ray serene<br />The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear;<br />Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<br />And waste its sweetness on the desert air.<br />—Elegy in a Country Churchyard"},{"class":"b44","text":" How peculiar it is to find that the master of everything is a thief.

His slogan was, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Eho bāhya, āge kaha āra</span>: these things are external; go deeper, go deeper.” When Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu asked what is further and higher than all these different conceptions of theism, Rāmānanda Rāy suggested jñāna-śūnyā-bhakti, unalloyed devotion.

One can begin a life of bhakti independently of karma and jñān—from any position. Bhakti need only be developed through sukṛti, accumulated devotional piety, and through ruchi, our eagerness and earnestness for Kṛṣṇa. That is what is necessary, and not our aspiration to know anything and everything (jñān) or to have so much energy under our control (karma). These two paths lead us to exploitation and renunciation. But wherever one may be, if he wants to get in touch with the Lord, he need only have some inclination to hear about Him from a proper source, a real saint. This is the proper beginning of bhakti. And so, one may begin in the bhakti school independent of any position in the social system of varṇāśram."},{"class":"b44","text":" To become Kṛṣṇa conscious, one need not be a wise man, nor a very energetic man, he may not be a master of opulence and power—the only requirement that is demanded from him is that he must have an earnest hunger for the Lord.

Through his taste for Kṛṣṇa, one will progress from ruchi to the ultimate end of life."},{"class":"b69","text":" So, we are told, “Giving up everything, and even rejecting all conceptions of society and religion as external, exclusively surrender to Kṛṣṇa.” Without hesitation, one should take exclusive shelter of the Lord with full confidence, giving up bad association, and even neglecting the regulative principles governing society and religion.

Finally, when it reaches the personal conception of the Absolute, it will experience some sort of satisfaction. Still, it won’t stop there. It will go up to Goloka. It will not stop with the calculative devotion of Vaikuṇṭha. Crossing that plane, it will rise up to the stage of spontaneous, automatic devotion."},{"class":"b70","text":" Back to Godhead"},{"class":"b43","text":" There we will find the Lord of love.

That is what is needed by everyone: to enter into the land of love and achieve some engagement in the loving service of the central representation of absolute sweetness, beauty, and love. And that highest Absolute Centre came down as Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu to invite His long lost servants to return to His home, saying: “I have come to invite you and to take all of you to My home—come with Me!” What a fortunate opportunity we have!

We may not want to have the power of control over all, but we want to know everything; we don’t like to be ignorant. But that is also not the ultimate end which can fulfil our inner necessity. That is not what we really want. We must become educated about our actual necessity—the inner search of our hearts. If we do that properly, we shall find that we are all beggars of love and affection. Adoration is the innermost necessity everywhere.

In the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, it is mentioned that praṇipāt, respectfully approaching, paripraśna, sincerely enquiring, and sevā, an attitude of service, are necessary to enter into the domain of divine love.

The world of sense experience will come and go through its different phases, but it cannot enter that spiritual plane.

They don’t approve of the idea of jñāna-śūnyā-bhakti, or “knowledge-free devotion”. Once, the founder of the Bhārat Sevā Ashram Saṅgha wanted me to join his mission. I told him, “My head is already sold to the teachings of Śrī Chaitanyadev.” He said, “Yes, I also revere Him, but I say that first you must learn indifference to this worldly pleasure, as Buddha preached. Then you may come to study the Vedānta of Śaṅkar, understand what is knowledge proper, and realise that all this world is nothing, and brahma, spirit, is everything. Then you may approach the prema-dharma, the love of Śrī Chaitanyadev, which I also think to be the highest object of attainment.” I answered, “You say so, but Śrī Chaitanyadev did not say that we should go to the Buddhist school to learn abnegation and then to the Śaṅkar school to acquire Vedāntic knowledge before coming to Him. He said that wherever one is, one should get the association of a real Vaiṣṇava saint and go on with śravaṇ-kīrtan, hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord.” That man was struck dumb. He could not speak; he was silenced."},{"class":"b69","text":" Another time, the president of the Arya Samaj came to see me in Karachi and told me that, “If the finite can know the Infinite, He is not infinite.” I replied, “If the Infinite cannot make Himself known to the finite, He is not infinite.” He could not answer my argument."},{"class":"b70","text":" All rights reserved"},{"class":"b43","text":" So, it is not from any qualification on our side that the Absolute can be caught. Whomever He chooses to make Himself known to will know Him. This is explained in the Upaniṣads: He cannot be known by lectures or discussions, by sharp memory or vast intelligence, or by genius or supernatural intellect. One may have extensively studied all the revealed scriptures, but that is no qualification. Kṛṣṇa reserves all independence on His side. There is only one way by which He can be known: whomever He chooses to make Himself known to can know Him. Otherwise all rights are reserved there by His sweet will."},{"class":"b44","text":" How can we draw His sweet will? That is the question. How we can tackle His sweet will. That can only be done through śaraṇāgati, surrender, by increasing our negative side. We must think, “I am so poor; without Your grace, I can’t live.” We must think like this to try to arouse pity within His heart. We must appeal to His understanding that we are in extreme need of Him and that without His grace we can’t live. Only such a sincere feeling of necessity can draw His attention to us. Otherwise, we have no possibility for capturing Him. So, the negative approach has been recommended for capturing Him. Our exclusive prayer is that we are the most needy and sincere.

This quarrel is a useless waste of time, but still it will never stop; it will continue forever. Why? Because there are those who have the eyes to see God and those who have no eyes to see Him or their own self. One of these classes of men has deviated from God consciousness.

Come with me, I shall show you.” The boy replied, “Yes, I shall go”, but he began to take a lantern with him. His friend remarked, “It is not necessary to take the lantern.” The boy said, “What do you say! Do you think that I am a fool? Can anything be seen without the help of a lantern? I am not a fool!” Then his friend forcibly took him by the hand and showed him the sun. The boy said, “Oh, this is the sun!

He cannot be seen by our knowledge, just as the sun cannot be seen by the help of any other light. It is not necessary that we try to acquire God consciousness through intellect or knowledge. Knowledge of God is independent. It can come and go of its own accord. And if He comes to me, everything comes to me. But nothing can force Him to come within our vision.

Buddha says that life itself is unnecessary; that there is in actuality no labour, no life, no existence. According to the Buddhist school, we can do away with our existence. It is a mania to keep up our existence in the struggling world, so we should do away with this mania. Why should we live at all? So, the Buddhists advocate nirvāṇa, the cessation of existence."},{"class":"b44","text":" And Śaṅkar Āchārya says, “Of course there is life, but this life is not desirable. We are always suffering from injury, and there is a force which is always diminishing us, and ultimately we die. We are challenged by slow death, slow poison.” It is true that life in the world of mortality is undesirable. Then, what is the solution? Śaṅkar says that the endeavor to maintain one’s individual self is undesirable. There is no possibility of maintaining individuality and at the same time enjoying real peace, eternal peace. So, we shall have to give up the charm of individual life."},{"class":"b44","text":" According to Śaṅkar, there is one universal spirit, and that is a blissful conception. We are merely reflections of that. That spirit has been reflected everywhere. Somehow it has created this mysterious individual ego or consciousness. We must not be very eager to maintain this false ego; we must dissolve it. And when that is done, we shall find that only spirit remains."},{"class":"b44","text":" In our present condition, there can be no cure to the disease of mortality. At every moment, we are losing ourselves in some way or other. This cannot be solved. But Buddha and Śaṅkar have given only a partial understanding. But <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> says, “The proper solution is to practice abnegation, detachment from the environment, by seeing it in relation to the service of Kṛṣṇa. That knowledge by which you can attain perfection while maintaining your own individuality, interest, and prospect is possible only with bhakti, devotion, dedication. By exploitation you have to die. And by abnegation you merge into a sort of zero (Virajā, Brahmaloka) in some unknown quarter, never to rise from there again. But I recommend the kind of renunciation and knowledge which is embraced by devotion, dedication to Kṛṣṇa. If you accept that, then your inner self, your true self, can live forever in a happy life.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Naiṣkarmyam</span> means no pain of labour. A labour of love is the innate function of the soul. In our ordinary conception, labour carries a reaction. As we labour, things diminish and vanish, attacked by death. But these difficulties have all been eliminated by the recommendations given in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>. <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> advocates vairāgya and jñān embraced with bhakti, a life of dedication. <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> says, “Shake off exploitation and renunciation.

Renunciation and knowledge are complete in devotion, and at the same time you can maintain your individuality. “"},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> has harmonised knowledge and renunciation by supplying their very life in devotion. Through devotion, we can maintain our individuality, our activity, our prospect, and at the same time find immense peace and ecstasy in life. <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> offers us a happy, eternal life simply by adding dedication to jñān and karma."},{"class":"b44","text":" You will work, or energise; but it will not come under the jurisdiction of karma, which has a reaction. Your energy will be used for the Centre. <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> tells us, “Work only for the Centre; otherwise, you will be tied down with a reaction.” So, it has been made clear that a very laudable life is possible for us if we dedicate ourselves to the highest centre. That is neither dishonourable nor tiresome. Neither is it ignorance. So, we should take this course which <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> recommends for us."},{"class":"b44","text":" If we are attentive to that and try to follow the advice coming from the real source, from real saintly persons, we will become properly adjusted; we will develop a proper understanding. And everything will be harmonised. One who has this realisation will be victorious over all possible suggestions or conceptions of knowledge. Only by devotion, by dedication to Kṛṣṇa, can we very easily become free from ignorance in the world of suffering."},{"class":"b44","text":" To be a devotee means to serve; service is everything. Our proper life is to be found in dedicating ourselves and in self-distribution, not self-aggrandisement. We can live in service. All difficulties will be removed if we take to the line of dedication. There we will find everything: our individuality, the most favourable environment, our highest prospect. Only our angle of vision should be changed. And that angle of vision should be acquired through the Centre. We must try to understand how everything will be seen in relation to the Centre. Whatever we see, we must try to study its position in accordance with the Centre. We must locate or calculate what its position is in relation to the Centre. And with that angle of vision, we may establish our relationship to anything. If we can develop this vision, we will get relief from all undesirability. This is the teaching of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is the specialty of Bhāgavat philosophy. It always tries to establish the conception of divine love, divine sentiment, and divine feeling above intellectualism and the mastery over energy. The masters of power and the masters of knowledge have no value if devoid of the master of love. On the other hand, if it is possible for one devoid of knowledge and power to enter into the area of love, his life is successful. His movement is no longer considered as reactionary labour (karma), and his knowledge is real knowledge about Kṛṣṇa (sambandha-jñān). Real knowledge about Kṛṣṇa, His paraphernalia and who is who in the spiritual world, is not within the jurisdiction of the knowledge that we can obtain by conducting scientific research. It is not like that; it is fulfilled in itself."},{"class":"b69","text":" And Devarṣi Nārad came to Vedavyās to recommend to him, “You must introduce this very clearly in your present book. In the Vedas and Upaniṣads and in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Mahābhārata</span>, you have dealt previously with different aspects of knowledge and work. But it is not so clear. And now very clearly and definitely you should describe the success of life in its fullest form, independent of knowledge and energy.” It is possible to reinstate ourselves with our lost wealth independent of energy and intellectual research."},{"class":"b70","text":" The seal of ego"},{"class":"b43","text":" We have only to break the seal of the ego, and the natural flow of divine love will come and automatically help its own cause. Such an arrangement is there for us by which we may return home. We won’t feel that it is a tedious, laborious journey. We will be carried by our natural attraction, independent of external guidance. The tendency within us for divine love can understand its own soil; it has that natural gift of attraction. An automatic attraction will be there for our home; no scientific search is necessary."},{"class":"b44","text":" Rather, we will have to put a stop to our intellectualism, ambition, and aspiration. It is unnecessary. It is a wild goose chase. It will never help us to reach our goal. The heart will reject that. There will be no room for any suspicion at all. It is an infallible, natural, complete selection. So, we should try to find that natural thing which cannot be acquired as the result of any long program of research. It is quite natural. It is only the artificialism within us that must be removed and bid adieu forever. And the reactions that we have acquired after so long in our false journey will evaporate out of their own accord. They will present no problem. This is certain. There will be no reaction, and no necessity of finding any new discovery or invention. Once achieving that realisation, we will see that our “progressive-knowledge-civilisation” is all redundant."},{"class":"b44","text":" No intellectualism is required. Just as a child knows his mother, we can recognise our real home. In the midst of so many cows, a calf will run to its own mother. They have some instinctive scent or a natural guidance that directs them. In the same way, no trouble, no investigation, no experiment, or suspicion is necessary. Devotion to Kṛṣṇa is automatic, natural, happy, and spontaneous. It is a spontaneous life, an automatic flow, a natural movement."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our real interest is love. Love is independent of everything. It is the innermost substance in our existence. “Try to dive deep into reality”, we are told. “Dive deep into reality, and you will find your home there in that divine realm. You are a child of that soil.” That is the message of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> and Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. And that is not a very meagre conception, an abstract or hazy dream, but that is the most intense and concrete reality."},{"class":"b52","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu demonstrated this by His character, by how intensely He searched for Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and by how intensely and deeply He engaged Himself in the līlā of Kṛṣṇa, ignoring so many facts which seem concrete in the outside world. Forgetting everything, despising everything which is so important to us, He neglected all other functions and considerations of duty. He engaged Himself in Kṛṣṇa-līlā so deeply and intensely—diving deep into it—that it captured His whole heart so much that He was externally found to be helpless."}]},{"title":"The Holy Name","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b47","text":" The Holy Name"},{"class":"b43","text":" If it is to be effective, the sound of the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa must have a divine quality.

If it is to be genuine, the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa, Hari, Viṣṇu, or Nārāyaṇ must be Vaikuṇṭha-nām: it should have spiritual existence, divine backing. That principle is all-in-all in vibrating the Holy Name."},{"class":"b44","text":" We are concerned with sound vibration that has spiritual depth. The physical imitation of the Holy Name is not the Name proper; it is not śabda-brahma, divine sound. Only imitation sound may come from the plane of mundane conception.

Something spiritual must be distributed through the physical sound."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the case of a capsule of medicine, the capsule is not the medicine; the medicine is within. Externally, one capsule may look like another, but within one capsule there may be medicine and within another there may be cyanide. The capsule itself is not the medicine.

The Holy Name must be surcharged with the proper spirit, not any mundane sentiment."},{"class":"b69","text":" Even the followers of the impersonal Śaṅkar school have faith that the Name is not confined within the jurisdiction of physical sound. They consider it to be within the mental plane, within the plane of sattva-guṇa. Unfortunately, they think that the Holy Name is the product of māyā, or misconception, and so they conclude that the names of Hari, Kṛṣṇa, Kālī, and Śiva are all one and the same. The Ramakrishna Mission and the Śaṅkar school both preach in that way. But that conception also has its origin in the plane of misunderstanding."},{"class":"b70","text":" Divine sound"},{"class":"b43","text":" The divine sound of the pure Name (Śuddha-nām) must have its origin beyond the area of misconception or māyā. The extent of māyā is up to the highest planet in the material world, Satyaloka. Beyond Satyaloka is the Virajā River and the world of consciousness, Brahmaloka, and then the spiritual sky, Paravyoma. The pure Name of Kṛṣṇa must have its origin in Paravyoma, the spiritual sky. And if we are to examine it further, the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa really comes from the most original plane of all existence: Vraja, Goloka. According to this understanding, the sound must have its origin in the highest plane of the spiritual world in Vṛndāvan if it is to be considered the genuine Kṛṣṇa Name."},{"class":"b44","text":" The mere physical sound is not the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa. A true conception of the Holy Name is necessary, not only to free us from this world of misconception, but also for the attainment of service to Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvan. Only that true Name of Kṛṣṇa which has its origin in the plane of Vṛndāvan can lift us up and take us there."},{"class":"b44","text":" Otherwise, although the spirit is within the Name, if the sound we vibrate is based on any other conception, it may only take us to that layer of conception. This is quite scientific; it is not unreasonable. The mere word <span class=\\"e3\\">Kṛṣṇa</span> is not the Holy Name. What is important is the meaning of that sound and the depth of meaning, the deep conception of the meaning of the Name. That is everything—it is all-important in serving our purpose."},{"class":"b69","text":" There’s a nice story that illustrates this point. When our spiritual master, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur, was a young boy, both he and his father, Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, went to visit the holy place of Kulīna Grām, which is located in the Hooghly district near Kolkata.

He found that brickbats were being thrown about from different directions. He thought, “How is this happening and why? Who would throw big brickbats like this?” Then he had some apprehension that there might be ghosts living there, creating disturbances. He began loudly chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra. After some time, the disturbance disappeared, and Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur and Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta passed the rest of the night there peacefully."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the morning, they entered the village and began visiting different holy places. After some time, one of the local gentlemen noticed them and said, “You entered our village early this morning. Where do you come from? And where did you spend the night?” Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur explained, “We stayed in that temple just outside the village there.” One of them said, “Oh! How could you stay there? So many ghosts live there and throw stones and bricks at anyone who passes by that place at night. How could you stay there?” Then Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur said, “Yes, you are right. But when I found such a disturbance there, I began to loudly chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra, and subsequently the problem disappeared.” The men of the village then asked Bhakti Vinod, “Who are you, and where are you coming from?”"},{"class":"b69","text":" Then they came to know that he was Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur. They had already heard of him, and some of them had read his books. They welcomed the two of them and showed them all the holy places they had not yet seen. At one point, they said to Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, “The gentleman who was formerly the priest of that temple was transformed into a ghost after his departure. Since that time, we have regularly seen the disturbances caused by that ghost. Why did he become a ghost? As the priest of that temple, he used to regularly chant the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa. We are witness to that fact; we have all heard him. Why was he turned into a ghost? We cannot understand this. Please explain.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" Lip-deep sound"},{"class":"b43","text":" Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur told them that the priest must have only repeated the syllables of the Name, the Nāma-akṣara. What he was producing was only a māyik sound, a physical, lip-deep sound. It did not have the spiritual essence; the life of the Name was absent when he was chanting. It was Nāmāparādha, offensive chanting. Bhakti Vinod asked them, “What was his character?” They said, “He was not a good man. He committed many sinful acts. That we know. But we can’t deny the fact that he used to chant the Name of the Lord almost always. How could he become a ghost?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur explained that the physical sound of the Name is not the Name proper. The priest had been committing offences to the Holy Name (Nāmāparādha), and as a result became a ghost.

It is mentioned in the scriptures that this is the only way to become free from the entanglement of material nature.” After this discussion, Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur and Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī left Kulīna Grām."},{"class":"b44","text":" From that day on, all the troubles caused by the ghost at the temple in Kulīna Grām ceased. The villagers were astonished. One of them said, “That priest who had become a ghost must have been released from his ghostly condition after hearing the Holy Name chanted by Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur. When the trouble began, Bhakti Vinod loudly chanted the Name, and gradually, by hearing the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa from his holy lips, that suppressed soul has been liberated from his condition as a ghost.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" After that, many people journeyed to see Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur. They would tell him, “We are confident that you are a great Vaiṣṇava—after hearing the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa from your lips, a ghost has been released.” This story was published in the newspapers, and Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Prabhupād used to recount this story of his own experience with Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur."},{"class":"b69","text":" The point is that simply the external sound of the Name is not the real Name. The most important thing is the spiritual realisation backing the Name—that is the real Name. Otherwise, a tape recorder can pronounce that Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa. Even a parrot can pronounce the Name—but the physical sound is not the thing itself. In the background there must be spiritual truth, which is conscious. That super-knowledge is beyond the knowledge of this mundane plane."},{"class":"b70","text":" Supramental Nām"},{"class":"b50","text":" This understanding is confirmed by Rūpa Goswāmī Prabhu in his verse:"},{"class":"b60","text":" ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ<br />sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ"},{"class":"b43","text":" He says that Kṛṣṇa’s Name, Form, Qualities, and eternal associates—everything about Him—are not mundane, but purely spiritual.

This is true not only for our physical senses, but for the mind also. Our minds cannot conceive of Kṛṣṇa. He is transcendental and supramental. His existence transcends all the knowledge in our possession."},{"class":"b69","text":" We cannot be the subject and make Kṛṣṇa our object. He is the subject. He exists beyond both the ātmā and Paramātmā. We should never forget that. We should always be mindful of the plane in which He exists. As finite souls we are taṭasthā-jīvas—the marginal potency of the Lord. The tiny soul can think and know only those things which are more gross than himself. But in trying to know that which is more subtle than himself, he is helpless. A connection with that higher spiritual realm is only possible when the higher area wants to bring the lower up into that plane. Therefore, to understand Him is possible only through surrender (<span class=\\"e3\\">sevonmukhe hi jihvādau</span>)."},{"class":"b70","text":" Divine slavery"},{"class":"b43","text":" If we can accept the current of surrender—if we can die as we are and surrender our innermost self at His disposal—His will can easily carry us up to the spiritual platform. Our soul will become as a blade of grass in that current, and so be carried up into the centre of the infinite. It is not that we can enter there and walk proudly as we do here in this gross material world. Here we walk on our feet, but there we shall walk with our heads. Only by the Lord’s grace upon our heads can we attract that plane to take us up."},{"class":"b44","text":" Everything there is qualitatively higher than our own existence. The substance of that divine realm, the atmosphere, the air, the ether—everything there—is higher than any value we might have. Only those with a sincere spirit of service may be allowed to enter there.

We must accept this creed from the beginning. Still, the atmosphere there is so happy and loving that no one there feels any distinction between slave and master. A slave there has no sense of being a slave. Everyone is family. Having attained the state of divine slavery, one should consider: “I am a slave—the generosity of Kṛṣṇa and His eternal associates is my wealth.” But by the power of yogamāyā, those who are taken up into that plane forget that they are slaves. That is the greatness and magnanimity of that atmosphere where love is intensely flowing. It is really by their love and not by our own fortune that we may somehow gain entrance into that high and noble land."},{"class":"b44","text":" But to realise this we must realise the spiritual position of Kṛṣṇa’s Name, Form, and eternal associates. Kṛṣṇa’s Name is not material. We cannot capture the Name of Kṛṣṇa simply by vibrating the syllables of the Name with our tongue. Rāvaṇa wanted to capture Sītā Devī and thought that he had done so. But the fact was that he could not even touch the holy body of Sītā Devī."},{"class":"b44","text":" What Rāvaṇa captured was only a mundane representation of Sītā Devī, a material double, an imitation which was like a statue of Sītā Devī. Sītā Devī herself is another thing; she is not made of flesh and blood. For a person here in this world, Sītā Devī and her divine plane is not at all approachable. A mundane person cannot see, feel, or enter that plane—what to speak of the possibility of snatching Sītā Devī and taking her away. The scriptures have explained that Sītā’s capture was all show. Rāvaṇa was cheated. Of course, the apparent kidnapping of Sītā by Rāvaṇa was done to serve some purpose, to teach something to the people of this mundane world. But in the real sense, no Rāvaṇa can come in connection with any of the eternal associates of the Lord who are living in Vaikuṇṭha. In the same way, no mundane person can touch the Vaikuṇṭha Name simply by imitating its sound."},{"class":"b69","text":" Recently, I was asked about a young boy who had been killed in an accident. I was told that he shouted the name of Kṛṣṇa at the time of death. I was asked “What was his destination?” I explained that whether one is young or old in the plane of flesh and blood is no qualification for spiritual attainment. One’s mentality must be examined.

Still, You are chanting the name ‘gopī, gopī’. What benefit will You get from that? The scriptures say that if You chant the Name of Kṛṣṇa, You may get some benefit.

In this example, we find that Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu was chanting “gopī, gopī” and neglecting the Name of Kṛṣṇa. Apparently, He was advised to take the Name of Kṛṣṇa and became enraged—but what is the underlying thought there?"},{"class":"b44","text":" If we are to understand the effect of someone’s chanting of the Holy Name, we must examine his underlying purpose. Sometimes his chanting may have some effect, but not always. Still, Jīva Goswāmī mentions the following example as evidence that the Holy Name may have some effect even if one is unaware of its full meaning. Once, a wild boar attacked a Mohammedan, and the Mohammedan cried, “Harāma! Harāma!” <span class=\\"e3\\">Harāma</span> means “that abominable hog!” On the other hand, <span class=\\"e3\\">Ha Rāma</span> means “the Lord”, who has allowed a hog to attack me. Somehow, Lord Rāma was invoked, and the Holy Name had a divine influence on the Mohammedan, who attained liberation."},{"class":"b44","text":" Another example given in the scriptures is that of Vālmīki. Before becoming a saint, the sage Vālmīki was a dacoit. But the great saint Nārad had a plan to benefit him. Nārad thought, “This person is the most notorious and heinous dacoit I have ever seen. Let me experiment with him to see the potency of the Holy Name. I shall ask him to chant the Holy Name of Rāma.” He tried, but Vālmīki could not pronounce the Holy Name of Rāma. Then, Nārad told him to chant <span class=\\"e3\\">marā</span>—the word for “murder”—instead. The dacoit said, “Yes, I can do this. This is just the opposite of the Name of Rāma.” He began to chant “māra-māra-māra-māra-rāma-rāma-rāma-rāma.” In this way, after some time, <span class=\\"e3\\">māra</span> became <span class=\\"e3\\">Rāma</span>. Vālmīki began to chant the Name of Rāma, and gradually his mental attitude changed. So, it is possible for the Name to have an effect on someone even if he has no proper conception of its meaning. This is called Nāmābhās: the shadow of the Name. It can effect liberation. But a real devotee is not interested in liberation. He wants to enter the domain of divine service."},{"class":"b44","text":" The sound and its effect depend upon the attitude we accept and the quality we can conceive, because the actual Vaikuṇṭha-nām is infinite. In that plane, the Divine Name is equal to the substance named. When the sound aspect is one and the same with the original aspect of the thing, that is Vaikuṇṭha-nām. Here in this world, a blind man’s name may be Padmalochan—lotus-eyed—but really he may be blind. The name and the figure may be entirely different. But in Vaikuṇṭha, in the infinite world, the name and the named are one and the same."},{"class":"b44","text":" Yet to experience the Vaikuṇṭha-nām, one must avoid both Nāmāparādha, offences to the Holy Name, and Nāmābhās, the shadow of the Holy Name.

But the ordinary physical sound cannot represent the real Name, which is supernatural."},{"class":"b69","text":" It is said that one Name of Kṛṣṇa can remove more ignorance and sin than a man has the power to commit. But what is the quality of that one Name? We may chant the physical name of Kṛṣṇa so many times without getting the result of even one real Name. There is a great difference between the ordinary sound of the name, the superficial māyik name, and the pure Name. The pure Name is one and the same with Kṛṣṇa, but that descends down to our level only by His grace. We cannot vibrate it simply by dint of our moving our tongue and our lips. The pure Name of Kṛṣṇa is not lip deep, but heart deep. And it ultimately goes beyond the heart and reaches the land of Kṛṣṇa. When Kṛṣṇa comes down, the Name Kṛṣṇa comes through the heart and moves the lips and tongue. That vibration is the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa-nām."},{"class":"b70","text":" Negative power"},{"class":"b43","text":" When Kṛṣṇa in the form of sound descends from the transcendental world into the heart, and from the heart, controlling every aspect of the nervous system, comes to the lips and begins dancing there, that is Kṛṣṇa-nām.

The spiritual sound has to come down into this plane; He can come down, but we cannot so easily go up there. He is the Supersubject; we are an object to Him. We cannot interfere with His independence. Only by the negative power of surrender can we attract the Supreme Positive to come down to our level."},{"class":"b44","text":" And so the Holy Name is not a production of our senses. It can be realised only when we approach Him with a very intense serving attitude. At that time, Kṛṣṇa Himself may come down by His grace, being attracted by our serving nature. Then, He can influence this element and produce transcendental sound and dance within the mundane plane. That is the Holy Name, the Vaikuṇṭha-nām, the real Name of Kṛṣṇa. We cannot produce it with our lips. The sound we create with our physical or mental production is not Kṛṣṇa. He is independent from whatever sound we may produce, and yet, because He controls everything, He can appear anywhere, in any form, in any plane, in any sound."},{"class":"b44","text":" And this is confirmed in <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (4.6). Kṛṣṇa says, “When I come here by the power of My internal potency, I remove the external potency’s influence and appear anywhere and everywhere.” The mundane wave is forced back, just as a plane rides in the sky and pushes back the influence of air and wind as it forcibly passes. By removing the influence of the material waves, He appears within this world by the strength of His own force."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Lord says, “I have My own potency, and by the power of that potency, I remove this gross material energy. And so I live and move here in this world.” The laws of material nature cannot apply to Him. He has special power. And with the help of that special power, He subdues the laws of material nature and comes here. He does whatever He wants with His own potency. Wherever He goes, the laws of material nature withdraw from that place and give Him His way. In this way, He can appear within the realm of sound as the Holy Name."},{"class":"b69","text":" The real importance of the Name is not to be found merely in the arrangement of its syllables, but in the deep meaning within that divine sound. Some scholars argue that in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Kali-santaraṇa-upaniṣad</span>, Lord Brahmā says that the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra is properly pronounced only when the Name of Rāma precedes the Name of Kṛṣṇa: “<span class=\\"e3\\">Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare</span>.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" Kṛṣṇa-nām"},{"class":"b43","text":" In the <span class=\\"e3\\">Kali-santaraṇa-upaniṣad</span>, the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra is given in that way. But to say that the name of Rāma must precede the name of Kṛṣṇa in the mantra is a superficial understanding. It is said that because it comes from the Upaniṣads, the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is a Vedic mantra, and therefore, because the ordinary people may not have any entrance into Vedic mantras, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu readjusted this mantra by reversing the order of the words. In that way, it is said, the concern that it is a Vedic mantra is thereby canceled, and so Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu gave it to all without breaching the injunctions of the Vedas. Some devotees in Uttar Pradesh, who have great affection for Śrī Chaitanyadev, like to give this opinion."},{"class":"b44","text":" But our faith is that the mentioning of <span class=\\"e3\\">Hare Rāma</span> first is only superficial. It concerns the idea that since the Rāma-avatār appeared first and the Kṛṣṇa-avatār afterwards, the name of Rāma, <span class=\\"e3\\">Hare Rāma</span>, should come first in the mahāmantra. A deeper reading will consider that when two similar things are connected together, the priority will be ordered not on the basis of historical precedent, but in consideration of the most highly developed conception. The Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa is higher than the Holy Name of Rāma. This is mentioned in the Purāṇas: three names of Rāma equal one name of Kṛṣṇa. The name of Kṛṣṇa is superior to the name of Rāma. Where the two are connected together, the first position should be given to the one that is superior. Therefore, the name of Kṛṣṇa must come first in the mahāmantra."},{"class":"b69","text":" This is one point. Another point is that within the eternal plane, everything is moving in a cyclic order. In an eternal cycle, which is first and which is next cannot be ascertained, and so, in the eternal plane of līlā, it cannot be determined whether Kṛṣṇa is before Rāma or Rāma is before Kṛṣṇa. So, from that consideration also, since the Names of Kṛṣṇa and Rāma are eternal and unrelated to any historical event, we may begin the mantra from any place."},{"class":"b70","text":" Rāma means Kṛṣṇa"},{"class":"b43","text":" But above these considerations, our sampradāya has given another, higher consideration. A deeper understanding will reveal that the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is not at all concerned with Rāma-līlā. In the name of Rāma within the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, the Gauḍīya–Vaiṣṇavas will find Rādhā-ramaṇa Rāma. That means “Kṛṣṇa, who gives pleasure (ramaṇ) to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.” In our conception, the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is wholesale Kṛṣṇa consciousness, not Rāma consciousness. Śrī Chaitanya’s highest conception of things is always Svayam Bhagavān, Kṛṣṇa-līlā, Rādhā-Govinda-līlā. That is the real purpose of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s advent and teachings. In that consideration, the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra does not mention the Rāma-līlā of Ayodhyā at all. There is no connection with that in the highest conception of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra."},{"class":"b44","text":" And the inner conception of the mantra is responsible for our spiritual attainment. When one pronounces the name <span class=\\"e3\\">Rāma</span>, if he means Dāśarathi Rāma, his attraction will take him there, to Ayodhyā; if he means Paraśurām, he will be attracted to another place. And if Rāma means Rādhā-ramaṇa Rāma, he will go to Goloka. The inner conception of the devotee will guide him to his destination."},{"class":"b44","text":" My original name was Rāmendra Chandra. When I was given initiation, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur gave me the name Rāmendra Sundar. I asked him, “What is the meaning of Rāmendra?” He told me, “In our consideration, <span class=\\"e3\\">Rāma</span> does not mean Dāśarathi Rāma or Lord Rāmachandra, the son of King Daśaratha. It means Rādhā-ramaṇa Rāma—Kṛṣṇa, the lover of Rādhārāṇī.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The name <span class=\\"e3\\">Hare</span> may also mean different things according to one’s conception. That the meaning of the word <span class=\\"e3\\">Hare</span> in the mantra is taken to mean Rādhārāṇī is also determined according to the spiritual development or qualification (adhikār) of the chanter. When one is firmly established in conceiving of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa in the background of everything—when one finds Svayam-rūpa, the original form of Godhead, underlying all sorts of conceptions of all things good—then only will he find that sort of meaning and nothing else."},{"class":"b44","text":" For beginners, the word <span class=\\"e3\\">Hare</span> in the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra can be conceived to mean Hari. That is one meaning. It may also mean Nṛsiṁhadev. And just as <span class=\\"e3\\">Rāma</span> can mean Dāśarathi Rāma, <span class=\\"e3\\">Kṛṣṇa</span> may refer to different types of Kṛṣṇa. There is also a Kṛṣṇa in Vaikuṇṭha, where the vaibhavas, or extensions of the Lord, number twenty-four. In Vaikuṇṭha, first there is Nārāyaṇ, and then four extensions: Vāsudev, Saṅkarṣaṇ, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. Each of these four has five agents, making twenty-four in all. One of these is the Kṛṣṇa of Vaikuṇṭha. Then, there is the Kṛṣṇa of Dvārakā and the Kṛṣṇa of Mathurā."},{"class":"b44","text":" In this way, there are various conceptions of Kṛṣṇa. But the highest conception of Kṛṣṇa is Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvan: Rādhā-Govinda. When one cannot remove himself from that plane, he will conceive of divinity only as Hari-Harā. He will see nothing else but Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Those who are completely and perfectly installed in madhura-rasa—who have the highest kind of divine vision—cannot come down from that plane. If they do, it is only for the interest of Rādhā-Govinda. In that case, the devotee may go anywhere, but his real interest is under lock and key in Vṛndāvan. Only on behalf of the service of Rādhā-Govinda will a devotee leave Vṛndāvan."},{"class":"b69","text":" For those who are followers of the Vṛndāvan line, <span class=\\"e3\\">Hare</span> in the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra can only mean Harā: Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Harā means “Rādhā, who can even snatch the attention of Kṛṣṇa, Hari.” The word <span class=\\"e3\\">haraṇa</span> means “to steal”. One who can steal the mind of He who is most expert in stealing—who can steal even the mind of Kṛṣṇa—She is Harā. Stealing in its highest capacity is shown by Rādhārāṇī.

And with this conception, they go on with the service of Hari-Harā, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. They absorb themselves in Rādhā-dāsyam. They cannot think of anything else but that. And once having fully attained that plane, they can never come down from that level, from the interest of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. They cannot allow themselves to be out of that circle."},{"class":"b52","text":" That is the position of our highest aspiration, and according to a devotee’s adhikār, or spiritual qualification, that sort of meaning will awaken in one’s mind.

Every time they bowed down in this way, they would mark the spot where their fingertips touched the earth. Then they would slowly rise, step forward to where that spot had been marked, and again fall flat, offering their obeisances with great respect and adoration. In this way they were circumambulating the entire Rādhā Kuṇḍa. Upon seeing such intense worship, Paramānanda Prabhu, an intimate disciple of our Guru Mahārāj Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur, intimated to Prabhupād that the Diwan and his family must have great respect for Rādhārāṇī to circumambulate the Rādhā Kuṇḍa in such a fashion."},{"class":"b44","text":" At that time Prabhupād said, “Their angle of vision towards Rādhā Kuṇḍa and Rādhārāṇī is different from ours.

I want You and You alone. To have an independent relationship with anyone else, eliminating You, is impossible in my life. You must be first, and then others. Without You, we can never even think of a separate relationship with Kṛṣṇa.” Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj has written that without Rādhārāṇī’s company, Kṛṣṇa is not beautiful. Everything is relative—dependent. A teacher depends on the student, and the student depends on his teacher. Although Kṛṣṇa is the enjoyer, He is completely dependent on the enjoyed, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. The two are correlative; one cannot be separated from the other. As the enjoyed, Rādhārāṇī is also absolutely dependent on Kṛṣṇa, the enjoyer."},{"class":"b44","text":" Rādhārāṇī says, “My fate is lost forever because I have given Myself, I have sold Myself to many places. When I heard the flute, I dedicated Myself to the song of the flute. When I heard the Name of Kṛṣṇa, I dedicated Myself to that sound. And when I saw a beautiful picture of Kṛṣṇa, I wholly dedicated Myself to that picture. So, in three places I have sold Myself completely, with no possibility of any happiness or peace in My life. If I had dedicated Myself to only one thing, there might have been a possibility of peace, but because I have dedicated Myself in three different places, I am hopeless."},{"class":"b44","text":" “Seeing the picture of Kṛṣṇa, I couldn’t contain Myself.

It is impossible, My friends.” Rādhārāṇī did not know it at that time, but the source of Kṛṣṇa’s flute, His Name, and His beauty are one. If She could have seen how all three of these meet together, then it would have been possible for Her to have peace of mind. But it is difficult to understand this principle."},{"class":"b44","text":" How is it that the sound of Kṛṣṇa’s flute, the sound of His Name, and a picture of His form are nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa Himself? Idealism. In Hegel’s words, ideal realism. The absolute idea is not to be dismissed as an abstract thing; rather, it is the basis of all existence. Reality is there, but it is ideal realism.

I want to serve the feet-dust of those whose only wealth is the service of Śrī Rādhā. I want to fall before them and take the dust of their holy feet. If you cannot fix your mind in the service of Rādhārāṇī, then all your attempts to serve Kṛṣṇa are useless.

All of these other ladies who are famous for their chastity and piety are but partial representations of Rādhārāṇī. If we note the scriptures and scrutinise the position of those virtuous ladies, we’ll find that the source of all their chastity and devotion is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. She is the fountainhead of devotion. And so Bhakti Vinod says, “I bow down and take the dust of the holy feet of those who have as their only wealth the service of Rādhārāṇī.

But the lotus feet of Śrī Gaurāṅga will take you there safely.” In my Sanskrit poem dedicated to Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, I have explained all these points:"},{"class":"b60","text":" śrī-gaurānumataṁ svarūpa-viditaṁ rūpāgrajenādṛtaṁ<br />rūpādyaiḥ pariveśitaṁ raghu-gaṇair-āsvāditaṁ sevitam<br />jīvādyair abhirakṣitaṁ śuka-śiva-brahmādi sammānitaṁ<br />śrī-rādhā-pada-sevanāmṛtam aho tad dātum īśo bhavān"},{"class":"b43","text":" “What was sanctioned by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu by His descent was intimately known only to Śrī Svarūp Dāmodar Goswāmī. It was adored by Sanātan Goswāmī and served by Rūpa Goswāmī and his followers. Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī tasted that wonderful thing fully and enhanced it with his own realisation. And Jīva Goswāmī supported and protected it by quoting the scriptures from different places. The taste of that divine truth is aspired for by Brahmā, Śiva, and Uddhava, who respect it as the supreme goal of life. What is this wonderful truth? <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Radha-pada-sevana</span>: that the highest nectar of our life is the service of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. This is most wonderful. O Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, you are our master. It is within your power to allow them to bestow their grace upon us. You are in a position to bestow the highest gift ever known to the world upon us all. It is at your disposal. O Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, please be kind to us and grant us your mercy.”"},{"class":"b52","text":" So, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, our most benevolent Lord, has come to search for His long lost servants and to give to them this highest ideal of divine love."}]}]}')}}]);
