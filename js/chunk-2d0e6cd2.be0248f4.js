To deny divine revelation through another agent in the name of being chaste to one’s Guru can be offensive and even suicidal."},{"class":"b44","text":" As Guru is the functioning principle of divinity revealing Himself in this world, according to our different stages of realisations, he may appear in different forms. The chastity of a disciple is demonstrated in recognising the divine presence of Śrī Guru wherever it is found and bowing his head at the lotus feet of the agent through whom divinity is so kindly revealing Himself."},{"class":"b44","text":" The true chastity of the Vraja-gopīs was shown in their answering the flute-call of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the dead of night although apparently abandoning their husbands to do so (<span class=\\"e3\\">yā niśā sarva-bhūtānāṁ tasyāṁ jāgarti saṁyamī</span>). So, while some are sleeping in the bodily conception of Śrī Guru, others are awakening to the inner dimension of his divine personality. His Divine Grace Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj writes in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Guru and His Grace</span>: “We must not identify our Guru with the appearance we perceive with our physical senses. Our inner identification of him will be clarified according to the growth of our vision. When our vision increases and takes shape from material to transcendental, his look will also change accordingly. Otherwise, what we see will be based on a material conception. And to force the material conception onto divinity is a crime, it is ignorance, it is erroneous. We have to free ourselves from the snare of identifying reality with the physical form presented to our senses. By eliminating the external conception, we have to enter into the internal, and that will be all-important to a progressive disciple if we want to go to the inner world of substance.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In proportion to the depth and intensity of our inner hankering for a connection with divinity, our conception of Guru will expand. In separation from Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the gopīs began approaching even the trees and enquiring, “Where is Kṛṣṇa?” Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur writes, “The reflected form of the lotus feet of Śrī Guru in different receptacles constantly reveals many new matters for our instruction.” For those whose divine eye is awakened, they will find traces of divinity everywhere and in everything."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is our hope that the readers of this small booklet will approach the contents with an attitude of humble submission and an open heart.

Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj and Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj first met sometime in the year 1930 in Allahabad, India. In a taped conversation recorded in a 1973 meeting at Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s Maṭh at Nabadwīp Dhām, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj recalls: “So, we are very fortunate to hear His Divine Grace Om Viṣṇupād Paramahaṁsa Parivrājakāchārya Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Mahārāj. By age and by experience, in both ways, he is senior to me. I was fortunate to have his association since a very long time, perhaps in 1930, something like that. At that time, he did not accept sannyās; he just left home, and as a vānaprastha in his white dress, he went to Allahabad."},{"class":"b44","text":" “Mahārāj [to Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj], I think you remember the incident when you went to Allahabad? On that auspicious occasion, we were connected. There is a long story, it will take time, but I had the opportunity of associating with Śrīdhar Mahārāj for several years. Kṛṣṇa and Prabhupād liked him to prepare me."},{"class":"b44","text":" “Śrīdhar Mahārāj lived in my house for many years, so naturally we had very intimate talks, and he was my good advisor. I took his advices, instructions, very seriously because from the very beginning I knew that he is a pure Vaiṣṇava, a pure devotee, and I wanted to associate with him and tried to help him also. Our relationship is very intimate.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Herein, we find the history of a transcendental relationship between these two pure devotees of the Lord. Addressing Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj as “His Divine Grace” and Om Viṣṇupād—forms of address for one regarded as a spiritual master—Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj has transcended the norms of social etiquette and superficial formality. Intimately associating together for a concentrated period of over five years, often for five to seven hours daily, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj considered that “Kṛṣṇa and Prabhupād liked him to prepare me” for his future expansive missionary activities in the Western world. While remembering their intimate talks, specifically in regard to <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj recalls the depth in penetration of their discussions. “Once while discussing the verse <span class=\\"e3\\">dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena Mām upayānti te</span> (“I give them the understanding by which they can come to Me” (<span class=\\"e3\\">Bg</span>: 10.10)), I submitted to him that here, <span class=\\"e3\\">upayānti</span> is indicative of parakīya-rasa [paramour relationship]. On this point, he agreed with me, saying, ‘Yes, at this point there cannot be anything but the parakīya-rasa of Vraja. The conclusion of <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> must come to this.’”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Recognising Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj as “a pure Vaiṣṇava, a pure devotee” since the beginning of their relationship, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj most highly valued his instructions and advice. He would often consult with him regarding the spiritual significance of his failing business and family relationships."},{"class":"b44","text":" An example of how Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj tried to help Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj in his preaching work is seen in his appreciating Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s uncanny ability for extracting the essence of the scriptures. He helped to finance the publication of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s original Sanskrit-Bengali work entitled <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Śrī Prapanna-jīvanāmṛtam: Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls</span>. The book, as well as containing original Sanskrit verses composed by Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, is a compilation of verses from various Vaiṣṇava scriptures such as <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, and includes excerpts from the works of Rūpa Goswāmī. It is divided according to the six divisions of surrender."},{"class":"b44","text":" Constantly associating, whether in Allahabad, Calcutta, or other parts of India, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj and Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s relationship continually developed. Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj continues to recall their meeting:"},{"class":"b44","text":" “In my householder life, I had opened an office in Bombay for our business. The Bombay Gauḍīya Maṭh was established by Śrīdhar Mahārāj and myself. We made two parties for begging, collecting alms. Śrīdhar Mahārāj, myself, and Bhakti Sāraṅga Goswāmī Mahārāj. So, I took them to my chemist friends, and I collected about five hundred rupees. Śrīdhar Mahārāj would speak, I would introduce, and Goswāmī Mahārāj would canvass.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta</span>, Satsvarūp Dās Goswāmī writes: “Abhay would often accompany Śrīdhar Mahārāj and his assistants at preaching programs, where he would play the mṛdaṅga. And when Śrīdhar Mahārāj fell ill, Abhay led the other devotees on preaching engagements, performing kīrtan, playing mṛdaṅga, and giving lectures on the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span>.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" While still in Bombay, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj and Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj were the receiving party for a Gauḍīya Maṭh sannyāsī upon his return from Europe. Although dismayed by his changed appearance which was missing the tridaṇḍa of a Gauḍīya sannyāsī, the śikhā of a Vaiṣṇava, as well as the traditional robes, they still eagerly enquired in regard to the preaching field in the West. The sannyāsī remarked, “They ask questions that cannot be answered.” Concerned, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj enquired further as to the nature of those questions. One after another, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj answered them all. At last, the sannyāsī was left dumbfounded, and Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī boldly declared, “Today, Europe has been defeated by Asia!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" During the lifetime of Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj once composed a poem describing the ontological positions of Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur and the line of disciplic succession stemming from Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād was so pleased with the poem’s ontological depth and its happy style that he remarked: “Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur has written this through him. Now I am satisfied that although I may go, at least one man remains behind who can represent my conclusions.” In further appreciation of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s writings, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād informed the editors of the Gauḍīya Maṭh’s periodicals, “If you include articles written by Śrīdhar Mahārāj, the quality of your publications will be greatly improved.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" After the disappearance of Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād, the Gauḍīya Maṭh gradually diverged. With full knowledge of the events surrounding the disintegration of the Gauḍīya Maṭh, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī told his disciples in the same 1973 conversation, “Our relationship is very intimate. After the breakdown of the Gauḍīya Maṭh, I wanted to organise another organisation, making Śrīdhar Mahārāj the head.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Reciprocating the appreciation, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj advised the leaders of the Gauḍīya Saṅgha to confer the title “Bhaktivedānta” upon the then Abhay Charaṇ. Later, his sannyās-guru, Śrīpād Bhakti Prajñān Keśav Mahārāj, one of the most senior disciples of Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur and the first sannyās-disciple of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, gave sannyās to Abhay Charaṇ, retaining the title “Bhaktivedānta” and conferring the sannyās name “Swāmī”."},{"class":"b44","text":" Additionally, when Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj returned to India in October of 1967 after his successful preaching initiative in America, he stayed with Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj in Nabadwīp and observed his Vyāsa Pūjā celebration. At that time, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj wrote a letter to a disciple saying, “Yesterday, we have all come to Nabadwīp Dhām. This place is an establishment of one of my godbrothers. It is a very nice and extensive place, and my godbrother B.R. Śrīdhar Mahārāj has spared one entire house for our stay. He has also agreed to cooperate with our society. We shall observe his birthday celebration, and the brahmachārīs shall learn how to celebrate the spiritual master’s birthday.” Shortly afterwards, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj asked Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj to be the president of his newly formed society the International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" During the Vyāsa Pūjā celebration, one of Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj’s disciples saw Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj and Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj fully absorbed in a deep discussion in Bengali. The disciple inquired from Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj what was the nature of their talk, and he replied, “If I were to tell you, you would faint. Śrīdhar Mahārāj has very high realisations.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" That Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj continually regarded Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj as his advisor throughout his life is clear in the following letter written by him to one of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s disciples, Śrīpād Govinda Mahārāj. Concerned about his failing health, he had written Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj asking whether he should continue living in the United States or return to India to live his last days in Vṛndāvan. After receiving Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s reply, he wrote: “What Śrīpād Śrīdhar Mahārāj has directed, I take it on my head. He is my always well-wisher. After the departure of Prabhupād, it is appropriate that I should accept his direction. I got direction from him that I shall live in this country forever.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Sometimes it is said that one’s preaching contribution can be judged according to the number of temples established, devotees converted, and books published and distributed. Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj travelled and preached extensively all over India, personally accompanying Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur for many years. Nearly fifty years ago, he established the Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh on the banks of the Ganges in Nabadwīp Dhām, which is now a thriving institution. His followers have established temples in major cities throughout the world. His Sanskrit and Bengali writings have been appreciated by both scholars and devotees for their originality, depth of realisation, and happy poetic style. Published and widely distributed throughout the world, they are now available in English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, German, French, and are being translated into other languages."},{"class":"b44","text":" Throughout his life, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj always maintained the highest respect and confidence in Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj. He considered that whenever it was not possible for his disciples to proceed directly under his guidance, that they should take direction from Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj. He once wrote in a letter to one of his students: “Because you are my disciple, and I think, a sincere soul, it is my duty to refer you to someone who is competent to act as a Śikṣā-guru. For spiritual advancement of life, we must go to someone who is actually practising spiritual life. So, if you are actually serious to take instructions from a Śikṣā-guru, I can refer you to the one who is the most highly competent of all my godbrothers. This is B.R. Śrīdhar Mahārāj, whom I consider to be even my Śikṣā-guru, so what to speak of the benefit that you can have by his association. So, if you are serious about the advancement of your spiritual life, I will advise you to go to Śrīdhar Mahārāj. It will be very good for your spiritual benefit, and I will feel that you are safe. When I was in India with the others, we lived with Śrīdhar Mahārāj. You can also make arrangements for your other godbrothers to go there in the future. So, live peacefully with Śrīdhar Mahārāj, and thereby you will be spiritually enlightened.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In this passage, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj describes Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj as “the most competent of all my godbrothers”, “someone competent to act as Śikṣā-guru”, and in an astounding statement, he declares, “I consider Śrīdhar Mahārāj to be my Śikṣā-guru, so what to speak of the benefit that you can have from his association”!"},{"class":"b44","text":" What Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj means by Śikṣā-guru is best explained in his own words. In his purports to the Ādi-līlā of <span class=\\"e3\\">Chaitanya-charitāmṛta</span>, he states: “One should know the instructing spiritual master to be the Personality of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇadās Kavirāj Goswāmī states that there are two kinds of instructing spiritual masters. One is the liberated person fully absorbed in meditation in devotional service and the other is he who invokes the disciple’s spiritual consciousness by means of relevant instructions. There is no difference between the shelter-giving Supreme Lord and the initiating and instructing spiritual masters. If one foolishly discriminates between them, he commits an offence in the discharge of devotional service” (<span class=\\"e3\\">Cc</span>: 1.1.47)."},{"class":"b44","text":" Although it may be said that Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj encouraged his godbrothers in general, no one anywhere can produce a similar statement of endorsement. The fact is that Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj possessed the highest respect and appreciation for Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, and Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj is unparalleled in his understanding and admiration of Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj, as evinced in the following eulogy:"},{"class":"b44","text":" “So, our Swāmī Mahārāj has done a miracle! Ṭhākur Bhakti Vinod conceived and Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur began to translate this conception into action. And we find that through Swāmī Mahārāj, in his last days, it has been fulfilled to such a great extent. We are happy, we are glad, we are proud!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In response to this, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj with great humility, his voice choked with emotion, tearfully replied, “So, by Guru and Vaiṣṇava, whatever position I have got it is by Guru’s mercy and the blessings of the Vaiṣṇavas. Otherwise, how I may have? So, I wish that Śrīdhar Mahārāj may bestow his blessings, as he was doing always, and may Guru Mahārāj help me so I can do some service. By his grace, it has become successful. I have no credit. I do not know how things are happening, because I am not at all qualified: <span class=\\"e3\\">chhāḍiyā Vaiṣṇava-sevā, nistāra pāyechhe kebā</span> (‘Without serving an ideal Vaiṣṇava, who can be delivered from the clutches of māyā?’)”"},{"class":"b44","text":" And after the disappearance of Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj declared: “I consider him to be śaktyāveś-āvatār, and it is confirmed in his writings on his spiritual journey through the Atlantic. How he landed there in America, and the nature of his beginning the movement, his intense degree of dedication to Kṛṣṇa and dependence, and how much he made himself empty of any other desire than the order of his Gurudev—quite empty that Kṛṣṇa came down to help him, and it is corroborated that Kṛṣṇa worked on his behalf. In his poem, <span class=\\"e3\\">Prayer to the Lotus Feet of Kṛṣṇa</span>, we find him pleading with Kṛṣṇa, “My dear Brother, Your good fortune will come to You only when Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī becomes pleased with You.” Seeing his Gurudev Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī as Rādhārāṇī’s delegation and his order as Her divine service, he humbly submitted that he did not feel himself worthy or fit to discharge the divine service, so he enlisted Kṛṣṇa in the service of his Guru. He had completely dedicated himself to the purpose; he was so earnest in his prayer to Kṛṣṇa that he may discharge the duty that he has been given by his Guru Mahārāj that divine force, power, came down to help him. Otherwise, it is impossible. It is not a thing of the ordinary level that anyone will do, but the highest thing has been taken down to the lowest position so extensively. It cannot but be the divine power, embodied and in a great intensity and magnitude! So, śaktyāveś-avatār, I cannot but take him to be so.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" With such appreciation, there should be little doubt why Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj had implicit faith in Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj. He had even heard directly from Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād of the exceptional qualifications of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj. In their last known recorded meeting in 1977, just prior to Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī’s leaving this mortal world, we find him imploring Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj to take up residence at his Temple in Śrī Dhām Māyāpur."},{"class":"b51","text":" The conversation that ensues is a transcript of their taped conversation of March 1977."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī:</span> I do not know for how long I will be able to carry on.

Now, why don’t you come and stay at Māyāpur? Śrīla Prabhupād told me also, “Śrīdhar Mahārāj is one of the finest preachers.” I want to take you everywhere. At least at the place we have in Māyāpur, people are coming from all over the world. Why don’t you come and stay there? If you just agree, then whatever kind of building you want, I will arrange it for you. They are trying to build a house for me. So, both of us will stay there.

Most of the time I am travelling around, so if you are there, then they can get some guidance. So, Mahārāj, please, give me the order and I will make all the arrangements for you. That planetarium [the “Temple of Understanding”] also will be built under your direction. My idea is to combine the Indian culture and the American money, the lame man and the blind man policy. I tell them also that this will be very beneficial for the world."},{"class":"b44","text":" Here, in their final meeting, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj prophetically refers to his imminent disappearance and reveals that it is in this connection that he has come to see Śrīdhar Mahārāj. In friendly jesting, they discuss Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s reticence regarding large-scale preaching work. Of himself, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj has remarked, “I did not want to become a big person. That is not my nature. I did not want to move around with many people. I am just satisfied with whatever I have. My spiritual thinking is my life. The conclusions of the scriptures, the advices of the mahājans, to relish them and practise them and to discuss them in a small confidential circle, that is the main goal of my life.” In the ninth canto of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj, quoting Dhruva Mahārāj, writes: “‘My dear Lord, I am fully satisfied with whatever you have given me. I have nothing else to ask from You, for I am fully satisfied to be engaged in Your service.’ This is the mentality of a pure devotee who does not want anything material or spiritual from the Personality of Godhead. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore called Kṛṣṇa-bhāvanāmṛta-saṅgha, the association of persons who are simply interested in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Bhaktivedānta Swāmī testifies to his having personally heard Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād mark the high qualifications of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, whom he had once requested to go to the West. In this regard, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj once remarked, “My Guru Mahārāj wanted me to go to the West for preaching, but I don’t consider myself a fit person to preach in the West. Because, you see, I can’t follow your intonation. So [laughing], I must listen clearly, then I shall tell. So, in this way, I told that if you order, I must go, but I don’t think that I am fit to preach in the West. Anyhow, it was stopped, and Goswāmī Mahārāj was sent to the West.” When Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj had been selected, one of his godbrothers came to him and revealed the reason why Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād had chosen him to preach in the West. This godbrother explained, “Do you know why Prabhupād wanted you to be sent to the West? He said, ‘Because he can’t be converted.’”"},{"class":"b44","text":" And just twenty-four hours before his departure from this mortal world, Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād called for his beloved disciple Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj and asked him to sing the song of Narottam Dās Ṭhākur, <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Rūpa-Mañjarī-pada</span> (the lotus feet of Rūpa Mañjarī are my treasure). Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj recalls: “So I did, hesitatingly. My nature is always hesitating, pushing back. Then, Kuñja Bābu asked me to stop. I was not a good singer, so as soon as he suggested, I stopped. Then, Kuñja Bābu asked Purī Mahārāj of Kalna, ‘You sing.’ So, he began. Then, Śrīla Prabhupād was a little disturbed. ‘I don’t like to hear the sweet tune of the song’, he said. Then, he stopped, and I had to begin again with <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Rūpa-Mañjarī-pada sei mora sampada</span>. He wanted me to sing that song. That is the fulfilment of life of everyone of us, to be Rūpānuga—followers of Śrī Rūpa.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Senior godbrothers who witnessed this exchange have described it as a “mystic transmission” in which Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj was given admittance into the eternal entourage of Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī. Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s humble vision, however, is that he was posted as the gatekeeper, the guardian of devotion (bhakti-rakṣak), to protect the storehouse of conclusive truths about the full-fledged theistic conception of Śrī Kṛṣṇa as given by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" Further expressing his appreciation for Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s high realisations in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj says: “I want to take you everywhere. At least at the place we have in Māyāpur, people are coming from all over the world. Why don’t you stay there?” Sometimes it is wondered why Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj apparently did not take up Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī’s offer. Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj explains: “I said, ‘Of course I shall try to help you. Sometimes, I shall go and stay there with you.’ But I really did not think at the time that I shall survive him.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Finally, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj refers to “that planetarium”.

On the basis of this transcendental literature, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj had contemplated an elaborate preaching exhibition, showing graphically, with the use of dioramas depicting the varieties of material and spiritual planetary systems, how the ultimate spiritual destination is Kṛṣṇa’s own abode, Goloka Vṛndāvan. Due to insufficient funds, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj humbly submitted his idea to Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj, who approved, saying, “It will be built under your direction.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" And just prior to his departure from this mortal world, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj advised his senior disciples that in his absence, when the necessity arose to consult higher authority, that they should consult Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj. In conclusion, we humbly submit that the transcendental relationship between Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj and Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj be viewed and respected in terms of their eternal spiritual positions and long-standing appreciation and affection for one another."},{"class":"b52","text":" Since the departure of His Divine Grace A.C.

And his second attitude was to put a stop to all scholarly researchers and doctorates of different departments and to stop their boasting research. And third, to minimise, to slacken, the grandeur of the worship of Nārāyaṇ. He caused the domain of love to descend into this plane with the service of Rādhā-Govinda, establishing the flow of divine love from the heart as all-in-all. With that, we come to serve our object of worship, and he represented the service of Rādhā-Govinda as the highest attainment. That was his history.

The word <span class=\\"e3\\">gāyatrī</span> is a combination of two Sanskrit words: <span class=\\"e3\\">ganāt</span> (what is sung) <span class=\\"e3\\">trāyate</span> (gives deliverance). This means, “a kind of song by which we can get our salvation, relief, emancipation.” Gāyatrī is known as Veda-mātā, the mother of the Vedas. And Gāyatrī has produced the whole Veda. If we examine the Vedic conclusion from its most condensed aphorism to its most extensive expression, we shall find that it begins with oṁkār: the Vedic syllable om. That truth is expressed as the gāyatrī-mantra, then it appears in the form of the Vedas, and then as the <span class=\\"e3\\">Vedānta-sūtra</span>. Finally, the Vedic conclusion is given its fullest expression as Vedic knowledge progresses in this line; the gāyatrī-mantra must contain within it the meaning of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, that is, that the Kṛṣṇa conception of Godhead is the highest."},{"class":"b44","text":" This must be the meaning of the gāyatrī-mantra, but the problem is how to extract <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, the Kṛṣṇa conception, from within the womb of gāyatrī. I heard that Jīva Goswāmī has given such an interpretation, but I could not find where it is written. I heard that he has given the meaning of gāyatrī leading to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Anyhow, the tendency awakened in me to draw the meaning to the Kṛṣṇa conception. The general meaning of gāyatrī is “that song which grants liberation”. Now, liberation must have some positive meaning. Liberation means not freedom from the negative side but positive attainment. This is the definition given in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>: <span class=\\"e3\\">muktir hitvānyathā rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</span>. Until and unless we attain the highest possible positive position, mukti, salvation, has not been effected. Mere withdrawal from the negative plane cannot be called liberation. Hegel has said that the object of our life is self-determination. We must determine our normal function in the organic whole: not mere emancipation from the negative side but participation in a positive function in the domain of service. This is considered to be the highest attainment of life. This is the meaning of gāyatrī."},{"class":"b44","text":" The word <span class=\\"e3\\">gāyatrī</span> comes from two Sanskrit roots: <span class=\\"e3\\">ganāt</span> and <span class=\\"e3\\">trāyate</span>. <span class=\\"e3\\">Trāyate</span> means positive attainment to the final stage (<span class=\\"e3\\">svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</span>). And <span class=\\"e3\\">ganāt</span> means not mere sound, but musical sound. That musical sound which grants us the highest positive deliverance indicates the saṅkīrtan of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu and the flute-song of Śrī Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" The purport of the Brahma-gāyatrī-mantra is as follows. The first word is om. Om is the seed mantra which contains everything within it. Bhūr is where we are, Bhūloka, the world of our experience. Bhuvar is the world of mental acquisition. It is the support, the background of our experience. Our present position of experience is the effect of our mental acquisition. That we are here in the world of experience is no accident; we have acquired this position by our previous karma. The physical sphere, this present world of experience, is only the product, the outcome of our previous mental impulses. And the subtle world of previous karma, the mental sphere, is known as Bhuvaloka."},{"class":"b44","text":" The next word in the mantra is <span class=\\"e3\\">svaḥ</span>. Above Bhuvaloka is Svaloka. The mental world (Bhuvaloka) means acceptance and rejection: what to do and what not to do. “I like this, I don’t like that.” Svaloka, however, is the plane of decision, the world of intelligence (Buddhiloka). Our intelligence tells us, “You may like this, but don’t do that, for then you will be the loser.” That plane, the plane of reason, is known as Svaloka. In this way, this material world is composed of three general layers, Bhūr, the physical world, Bhuvar, the mental world, and Svar, the intellectual world."},{"class":"b44","text":" Of course a more detailed analysis will reveal seven layers: Bhūr, Bhuvar, Svar, Mahar, Janas, Tapas, and Satyaloka. This has been dealt with in detail by Sanātan Goswāmī in his <span class=\\"e3\\">Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta</span>. Here, these seven strata have been summarised in three planes of existence: physical, mental, and intellectual. And these three planes of experience have been summarised in a word, <span class=\\"e3\\">tat</span>."},{"class":"b44","text":" The next word in the Brahma-gāyatrī is <span class=\\"e3\\">savitur</span>. <span class=\\"e3\\">Savitur</span> generally means sūrya, the sun. And the sun means, figuratively, that which shows or illuminates, that by which we can see. The three gross and subtle strata within this world are shown to us by a particular thing: savitur. What is that? The soul. Actually, the world is not shown to us by the sun, but by the soul. What really gives us perception and allows us to see gross things? It is not actually the sun that helps us see; we see with the help of the soul. This is found in <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>: <span class=\\"e3\\">yathā prakāśayaty ekaḥ kṛtsnaṁ lokam imaṁ raviḥ</span>. The soul expresses this world to us just as the sun does. The sun can show colour to our eyes, but the ear can reveal the sound world, and the hand can reveal the touch world. So, really in the centre is the soul. It is the soul who gives light to this world, who gives us an understanding of the environment, the world of perception. All perception is possible only because of the soul. Here, the word <span class=\\"e3\\">savitur</span>, which generally means sun, can only mean soul, for the soul, like the sun, shows us everything."},{"class":"b44","text":" All seven strata of our existence represented by Bhūr, the physical plane, Bhuvar, the mental plane, and Svar, the intellectual plane, have here been reduced to one entity: tat, ‘that’. ‘That’ is shown by the ‘sun’ which in this context indicates the soul. Here, ‘soul’ means individual soul. The individual soul is the cause of his world. Not that the mind is in the world, but the world is in the mind. Berkeley has said that the world is in the mind. Here, it is being expressed that everything is seen with the help of the sun. If there is no sun, everything is dark; nothing can be seen. So, without light, nothing can be seen. And in a higher sense, “light” means the soul. The soul is the subject, and the soul’s object is the seven planes of experience within this world."},{"class":"b44","text":" The next word in the gāyatrī-mantra is <span class=\\"e3\\">vareṇyam</span>. <span class=\\"e3\\">Vareṇyam</span> means pūjā: worshippable, venerable. This indicates that although within this plane, the objective world, the soul is the subject, there is another domain which is to be venerated and worshipped by the soul. That is the Supersoul area."},{"class":"b44","text":" That worshipable plane of transcendental existence is known as bhargo. <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhargo</span> means the supersubjective area, the area of the Supersoul.

Śrīla Vyāsadev says that here he is going to deal with another world whose pristine glory is so great that by its own ray, all misconceptions are brushed aside. The subject is the soul, and its object is all these worlds of experience. And the supersubject is the venerable area which is superior to the subject, the soul; that is the supersubjective area."},{"class":"b44","text":" The word <span class=\\"e3\\">bhargo</span> means “more subtle that the soul” and “holding a more important position that the soul”. So, this means the Supersoul, the Paramātmā. In general, of course, the word <span class=\\"e3\\">bhargo</span> ordinarily means light. Just as an x-ray can show us what the ordinary eye cannot see, bhargo is svarūp-śakti: higher, more powerful light that can reveal the soul. And that energy bhargo belongs to whom? It belongs to Deva. What is the meaning of the word <span class=\\"e3\\">deva</span>? <span class=\\"e3\\">Deva</span> means, “who is beautiful and playful”, that is, Śrī Kṛṣṇa: Reality the Beautiful. He is not a nondifferentiated substance, but is full of līlā, Pastimes. <span class=\\"e3\\">Deva</span> means Pastimes and beauty combined, and this means Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" His domain is bhargo, brilliant, and it is vareṇyam, to be venerated by the jīva-soul. What is the nature of that svarūp-śakti? That is the vaibhava, the extension, of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. She holds the full service responsibility and the energy to serve Kṛṣṇa. Bhargo is no less than the vaibhava, the extended body, of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī which contains everything for the service of Kṛṣṇa. Bhargo represents Mahābhāva, the predominated moiety, and Deva, Kṛṣṇa, is Rasarāj, the predominating moiety."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the gāyatrī-mantra, we are requested, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Bhargo devasya dhīmahi</span>: come meditate.” What sort of meditation is possible in that plane of dedication? Not abstract meditation, but service cultivation, Kṛṣṇānuśīlanam. <span class=\\"e3\\">Dhīmahi</span> means to participate in the spontaneous flow, the current of devotion, in Vṛndāvan. And what will be the result? <span class=\\"e3\\">Dhiyo yo naḥ prachodayāt</span>: the capacity of our cultivation will be increased. As we serve, a greater capacity and willingness to serve will be given to us in remuneration just as interest is added to capital in the bank (<span class=\\"e3\\">dāsa’ kari’ vetana more deha prema-dhana</span>). In this way, our dedicating principle will be increased again and again. <span class=\\"e3\\">Dhīmahi</span> means ārādhana, worship. It cannot but be explained in terms of ārādhana, pūjā, sevā, worship, adoration, loving service. <span class=\\"e3\\">Dhī</span> is derived from the word <span class=\\"e3\\">buddhi</span>, which generally means “that which we cultivate with the help of our intelligence”. But here, <span class=\\"e3\\">dhī</span> is a reference to that venerable intelligence which descends into this plane to help us cultivate service. So, <span class=\\"e3\\">dhīmahi</span> does not mean abstract meditation but devotional service. This is the underlying meaning of the gāyatrī-mantra."},{"class":"b44","text":" Gāyatrī, the song for deliverance, also means saṅkīrtan. Kīrtan is also sung, and it also improves us towards the highest goal. The saṅkīrtan of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu also reinstates us in our highest serving position. So, Brahma-gāyatrī in connection with Mahāprabhu comes to mean Kṛṣṇa-kīrtan. Then, it reaches Vṛndāvan and the flute-kīrtan. And when we enter Vṛndāvan, we shall find that the sweet sound of Kṛṣṇa’s flute helps to engage all the Lord’s servants in their respective duties. When the flute is sounded, the gopīs and others are adjusted in their respective duties. At night, the gopīs, hearing the sound of the flute, will run to the Yamunā thinking, “Oh, Kṛṣṇa is there.” And when Yaśodā hears the song of Kṛṣṇa’s flute, she thinks, “My son is there. He is coming home soon.” In this way, the sound of the flute engages all the servants of the Lord in their respective positions and inspires them to be mindful of their service."},{"class":"b44","text":" In my commentary on the gāyatrī-mantra, I have written,"},{"class":"b64","text":" dhir ārādhanam eva nānyad iti tad rādhā-padaṁ dhīmahi"},{"class":"b44","text":" All other services are represented fully in Rādhikā.

The gāyatrī-mantra will excite us to be mindful about Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s lotus feet, to obey Her orders. She is mainly representing the whole serving area. So, to try to engage ourselves in Her service under Her order—to accept Her direction and to obey Her—that is the service of Śrī Rādhā. In this way, the meaning of the gāyatrī-mantra has been drawn to Rādhā-dāsyam, self-determination (<span class=\\"e3\\">svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</span>)."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the meantime, the partial representations in vātsalya and sakhya-rasa are also part and parcel of the original mellow of conjugal love, madhura-rasa.
