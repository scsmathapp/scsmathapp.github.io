In your estimation only two kilometers or two miles is great. But your brain can think “yes, the same sky is in America and in India” so some kind of broader conception is possible. Still even that is less than a mustard seed. ‘One mustard seed’ means fourteen worlds, up and down. All those planes together are called one <span class=\\"e3\\">brahmāṇḍa</span> or universe, and that is like no more than a mustard seed in the presence of the Divinity. Then how much can you guess?"},{"class":"b44","text":" If you can surpass the ideas of your entire consciousness then perhaps you can consider what kind of wonder that Ecstasy is.

Only when that Ecstasy will come and conquer our hearts can we feel it. And we must wait for that, not try for it. This is the way to taste it.
