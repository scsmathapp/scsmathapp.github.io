It did not like anything else in the environment but instead selected that advice."},{"class":"b51","text":" Many others do not care to come here and many may ridicule this life, but what made me come here? I cannot deprecate that internal approval, consciousness, and sincerity. Therefore, that is an important factor, and ultimately we have to depend on that internal consciousness the most. When collecting advice from the scriptures and when seeking or relying on advice from a sādhu, the only thing that takes me there is my internal approval, my inner friend. If it were not for that, I would not have come. Indeed, so many others do not come. So, who has taken me to this plane?"},{"class":"b59","text":" na hi kalyāṇa-kṛt kaśchid durgatiṁ tāta gachchhati"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> 6.40)"},{"class":"b43","text":" One who sincerely wants real good can never be deceived. When one is a real seeker of the truth, he can never be deceived. Kṛṣṇa says: “My dear boy, one who is sincerely hankering after the truth can never come across misfortune. If apparently some misfortune comes to visit him along the way, that is to enhance his position for his improvement.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Some sort of danger may come on our way, but if we are sincere, it will be as a test to us, and when we will overcome that, it will be an addition to our glory. The temptations will be rejected and disarmed—but they will plead for us again."},{"class":"b51","text":" So, sincerity—sincere hankering after the truth—is needed if we are to go further. And that is made of sukṛti—the grace of the divine agents who, by their nature, are wandering through this cursed land to help others who may not even know they are being helped."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Questioner:</span> What are śravaṇ-daśā and varaṇ-daśā?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Guru Mahārāj:</span> Śravaṇ-daśā is when one is satisfied by first hearing the philosophy, teachings, etc. during probationary life. When one is satisfied with śravaṇ, he then comes to accept a guide, a Guru—and that is the stage of varaṇ-daśā. He has the mood, “Now I am prepared to take formal admission in this line, and accept you as my leader. Now whatever you say, I must obey.” That is varaṇ-daśā."},{"class":"b44","text":" At first there is acceptance of a clan such as Christianity, Mohammedanism, etc., to which someone has been introduced. After first accepting a creed, a person will be selected who will be able to satisfy me according to the principles of that creed. He will be able to give me the desired end of life. He is Guru. First the creed is accepted, then the guide."},{"class":"b51","text":" Then beyond varaṇ-daśā begins sādhana-daśā. Sādhana-daśā is the third stage, and it means to follow the practices under the guidance of our Guru. By following that we shall gain some realisations and attain a tangible position: “Yes, I feel that what was in the words and propaganda is now in my heart. My heart feels its touch.” And that stage is called prapanna-daśā. Only after being thus established is one able to also distribute such things to others, and that stage is called āpan-daśā. Without being established in prapanna-daśā, only with the help of someone who is established there can we go to preach."},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Questioner:</span> Are there five stages?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Guru Mahārāj:</span> Śravaṇ, varaṇ, and sādhana are within this camp. Then comes prapanna—the tangible feeling, the position of oneself experiencing the thing—attainment. First we come in touch with that reality, then we become established in that real plane, and then we shall be able to distribute it to others—āpan."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Questioner:</span> When we have inner conviction, are we then safe? Also, does the external Guru help us to contact the Chaittya-guru, the internal Guru?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Guru Mahārāj:</span> The external Guru—Mahānta-guru—not only helps us to contact the Chaittya-guru, but he helps to prepare us so we can infallibly read the direction of the Chaittya-guru. At first, in a raw way, we may receive direction from the Chaittya-guru, and that draws us to the Mahānta-guru. With the help of the Chaittya-guru we come to the Mahānta-guru. The Chaittya-guru helps us in a raw way, in a general way which is not very systematic and clear."},{"class":"b44","text":" Coming to Mahānta-guru we feel, “Yes, with the help of my Chaittya-guru my internal hankering has been satisfied.” Then with the help of our Mahānta-guru we come to find that clear direction in our Chaittya-guru. They are helping one another. By the help of the Mahānta-guru our ability to read the Chaittya-guru becomes more clear, more skilfully developed. Our reading of the innate Chaittya-guru becomes more clear as we become cleansed of the different thoughts and ideas mixed up from yogīs, jñānīs, karmīs, and so many other different sections. The Chaittya-guru will give us more adherence to the Mahānta-guru, and in this way they each help the other."},{"class":"b44","text":" After receiving help from the Chaittya-guru, we come to Mahānta-guru, but sometimes it may also happen that after accepting Mahānta-guru, the Chaittya-guru again becomes covered. The Mahānta-guru will then take the disciple and help him cleanse the dirt that has covered his Chaittya-guru. The Chaittya-guru may become buried by some anartha or some Vaiṣṇava-aparādh, but the Mahānta-guru will come to give relief."},{"class":"b44","text":" Sometimes many may join the Mission and then go away. But the Guru does not allow them to easily leave. He tries his best to bring them back again and to a firm understanding: “Why have you gone away in order to search for other things?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “The desire for money and the attraction of free mixing with the ladies disturbed me and drew me away.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" If the Mahānta-guru is genuine, he will say that these particular desires should be removed. They are not the real objectives. For the good of the disciple he will explain the temporary nature of any connection with such things and how minor they are, and again try to reinstate him."},{"class":"b44","text":" Some dirt may enter someone, but by the grace of the Gurus the dirt will be cleansed in no time, and he will return to the real path."},{"class":"b44","text":" “Don’t disturb yourself with these little, tiny, filthy things. Don’t go away in this way.” Many immature and unfit persons may join the Mission, so it is not impossible that some sort of anarthas may come again to attack. It is like a fight. Sometimes one party gains ground, and sometimes that same party is losing. And ultimately, the real party will win the battle. It is a battle. In everyone’s heart there will be a battle because we are sādhakas not siddhas—we are not fully realised souls but we are following the process to realisation."},{"class":"b44","text":" Sometimes the devotees may feel defeated and sometimes may even go mad. But on the whole they shall have to make progress. Therefore, some sort of consideration and generosity should be allowed."},{"class":"b44","text":" We should think that we are in a hospital where there are so many diseased persons. This is not a place where all the healthy people live—it is not possible. We are also patients, and there are so many other patients. Patients are of different types; some may even die and some may have a relapse. But ignoring all these facts, with real interest for my own health, I must go on with the help of a doctor. Taking his help by following the proper prescribed medicine and diet, I will be cured. Just because so many others are getting worse or dying does not mean that my own health must also deteriorate."},{"class":"b44","text":" Another example is that in a school, all may not pass the examinations. Many will fail, but still a determined student must go on. We should not be discouraged from following the path of our eternal benefit just because of some unsuccessful candidates. I should not be cowed down by seeing this. I must be wakeful to the fact that this is my vital and only interest. I cannot just leave and go away."},{"class":"b51","text":" Everyone may go, but I must fight single-handed with the enemy. All may fly away, but, because this is my vital interest, I will stay and fight single-handed with self-determination. Why? “Because I have already understood and realised this to be my vital interest, so I cannot go back.” If even once we find this to be deeply rooted within our heart, such determined resolve must come from within. We will find this to be the very thing we were searching after."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Questioner:</span> Can a patient also become a doctor?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Guru Mahārāj:</span> Yes. When he is fully cured, has studied about medicine, and has undergone the necessary education of a doctor, he may become a doctor."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is necessary to be qualified and also appointed. You see, first of all it is necessary to be qualified, then by the appointment of the higher administration you can become a doctor in the hospital."},{"class":"b51","text":" You may engage in private practice if you are qualified, but to become a doctor in a hospital, you must have some sanction from above. In this way a sādhu can give assistance in several ways, but the Āchārya, holding a big position, should have sanction from above. And that is prapanna-daśā."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Questioner:</span> Who will decide whether the patient is qualified to be a doctor?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Guru Mahārāj:</span> External sanction is not necessary by letter, but he is to be already awake and fixed in the internal world. Inspiration will come from the internal world: “The people are suffering, and you have the medicine. You should distribute the medicine to the patients.” This may be seen in a dream, but while awake also, internal inspiration will come to you, and, because you know the medicine and you know the symptoms of the disease, irresistibly you will advance to help the patients. You have the medicine and you cannot but engage yourself in treating them. You will see this more clearly than daylight, more really than this world of experience."},{"class":"b44","text":" People are suffering but you have the medicine. You used that medicine and you were cured. Now you find another to be suffering from the same disease. You have the cure in your hand, so why should you not apply it? What explanation do you have not to do so?"},{"class":"b51","text":" It will not be for making money that you will give the medicine, nor for fame, but it will be due to the internal urge to help them. And you will find that the noble predecessors have also asked you to do so:"},{"class":"b59","text":" yāre dekha, tāre kaha ‘kṛṣṇa’-upadeśa<br />āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra’ ei deśa"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Chaitanya-charitāmṛta: Madhya-līlā, 7.128)"},{"class":"b43","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu instructed, “Whoever you meet, try to rescue them by talking to them about Kṛṣṇa.” If there is a ditch and you see a man about to blindly fall into it, will you not try to save him? It is a natural feeling. When it is plain, so very plain that it will happen, but you don’t help him, then you will be responsible. This common sense may be applied. But we must be sincere."},{"class":"b44","text":" The danger is that we must not be motivated by money, fame, or any worldly gain. Kanak, kāminī, and pratiṣṭhā are the three main disturbing elements that misguide us and draw us from this side to that. But when we are free from them, the street we walk shall be broad and clear."},{"class":"b44","text":" God is good, and you will like to see everyone becoming good by getting God. God is good, and God is great. When that superior type of thinking will be clear to you, all your activities will be controlled only by that one principle of life. And with that you will go on helping others with the firm faith that this must be given to all: “This is very tasteful. Please come to a safe position away from the danger-zone, and you will become happy.” The tasteful medicine will make people happy, and if that is actually in your possession, you cannot but feel the urge within to help others."},{"class":"b51","text":" With real knowledge all the general questions such as where we are to go, how to go, and why we should go are to be solved in order to help others."},{"class":"b59","text":" ‘ke āmi’, ‘kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya’"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Chaitanya-charitāmṛta: Madhya-līlā, 20.102)"},{"class":"b50","text":" Who am I? Why am I troubled? And how can I achieve my desired end?

Without the help of a higher agent, he will be nowhere; he’ll be lost. When he goes to cure a patient, if he will not be able to cure him, then the patients’ germ will attack him, and he will also die with the patient. In that case he won’t be of any help and he should not approach. He should inform the higher doctor and ask for better medicine to help his serious patient. In the case of doubt that, “With my meagre medicine and meagre instruments I may not be able to cure this patient”, one should not venture to approach the patient, but instead he will appeal to the doctor of a higher position. This is very reasonable."},{"class":"b44","text":" Following Mahāprabhu’s advice to help others, still it may be found in rare cases that the doctor approaches with a good heart to cure the patient, but he himself dies. It is also not impossible, but not desirable."},{"class":"b51","text":" When an organised party approaches for relief-work, some soldiers may be sacrificed before obtaining victory. The victorious party will also have to incur some loss when fighting with the enemy. Similarly, in the Mission some soldiers may be asked to approach the rich men and the women. Therefore, sometimes some may be lost. But their loss will be for the time being, and again they will come back. We expect them to come back again because once someone has a taste, he will not be able to forget that."},{"class":"b59","text":" nehābhikrama-nāśo ’sti pratyavāyo na vidyate<br />svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> 2.40)"},{"class":"b50","text":" Whatever has been acquired is eternal—it cannot be destroyed."},{"class":"b59","text":" kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> 9.31)"},{"class":"b55","text":" The assurance is given by Kṛṣṇa: “Even if he has come to Me only for the time being, he has taken some medicine before leaving, so he ultimately must come to Me again.”"}]},{"title":"Specific Service","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b58","text":" Chapter Six"},{"class":"b47","text":" Specific Service"},{"class":"b37","text":" by"},{"class":"b86","text":" Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Questioner:</span> The disciple sees his Guru as absolute, but others may see the same person in a relative conception.

But when he makes some progress and inner enlightenment begins, he will gradually find that Kṛṣṇa, the Absolute, has a particular system—an organic whole—and He has His potencies of different varieties. According to the disciple’s inner awakenment, he will have fitness for a particular class of service. That will be considered, and he will be taken, under guidance, into that particular type of service."},{"class":"b44","text":" When one sees his Guru, gradually, according to his innate capacity and quality, he will find dāsya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vātsalya-rasa, or madhura-rasa.

That is the general situation, and he will find his maximum gain there."},{"class":"b44","text":" At first the whole system is as if one.

But as much as you approach, you will find just specific parts, but with more clarity. And when you actually arrive, you will find your Lord and your friends, and you will mix there. At that time you do not find the whole of the Himalayas, but you are located in a particular position. And there, not with the whole, you will find that the desired end of your life has been fulfilled."},{"class":"b44","text":" Similarly, when you approach Kṛṣṇa from afar, He is sat-chit-ānanda—He is infinite.

There you will engage in whatever service is required of you, and from there you will draw the fullest satisfaction of your nature."},{"class":"b44","text":" Guru means guide. At first we are guided by attraction to ‘wholesale’ Bhagavān—Kṛṣṇa—and this helps us to make progress towards Him. Then, the more we gain, the more the big hazy vision is eliminated, and a particular place becomes more clearly revealed. In this way our vision, actions, and everything about us will become located in a particular part of the Infinite.

At first it is a hazy thing, a big thing, then after you were admitted, you were taken in and placed in a particular direction. Your attention was directed towards some post; you went there and gradually you were given some duty to discharge. The whole of the Mission is yours, but still you have a particular department and a particular duty, and that will increase more and more. It is possible that you may become the personal secretary of your Gurudev, or a preacher, or a cook for your Guru Mahārāj. And some may be asked to go to other places to preach. Sometimes those may be dangerous places for the devotees, but someone also has that kind of duty."},{"class":"b51","text":" Adjustment is necessary.

You are detached, you are infinitesimal, and you are approaching the Infinite, so you have to be located in a particular position of the Infinite. You are to adjust in this way. You cannot devour the whole of the Infinite within your belly. Do you like the idea of devouring the whole of the Infinite within your belly? Therefore, you have to be located in a particular infinitesimal position, and you will draw the maximum remuneration from that. If you are in some other place, you will be the loser.

I appreciated his explanation of the scriptures such as <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>. One day he told me, “Now the atmosphere here has been created in such a way that if I am ordered to construct a centre of our own, purchasing land, etc., then I can do, but that won’t be sanctioned by the authorities, because in that way I would become increasingly glorified. I would gain more pratiṣṭhā.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Presently I wrote in a letter to my Guru Mahārāj: “This Mahārāj has created a good, favourable atmosphere here. If he is ordered to construct a centre of our own, perhaps he can do. I think Benares is an important place, a meeting place of all different religious sections, so I feel we should have our own centre here. I pray that you may encourage this sannyāsī to arrange for it to happen.” We were at that time in a hired house, and the Deities were also established there."},{"class":"b44","text":" The reply did not come directly to me, but the general-secretary wrote to me, “We already know that his preaching is very successful. You try to listen to his analytical explanation of <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> and enrich yourself by that.” No mention was made about the point I had made. After some time our Śrīla Prabhupād went to Benares for some other purpose, and perhaps when I was alone, he suddenly said to me, “What will be the effect of karma-kāṇḍa? Karma-kāṇḍa is to use our energy for our own satisfaction, and not meant for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. What is the necessity of connecting something according to our whim? Only we shall do what Kṛṣṇa will desire, and that will be service.” He gave an example: “Suppose a Vaiṣṇava or the Lord has instructed, ‘Bring me some flowers’, and I collect the flowers, but as I am about to give them to him, he says, ‘No, no. I don’t want flowers, bring me water.’ If even at that time, I press him, ‘Oh, already you have ordered me to bring flowers, please accept these’, it will be karma-kāṇḍa. It will be thrusting my will upon him, it will not be service.” Because he is independent, he may order something—and again he may cancel that same order. He is in such a position that he is not bound by his own previous expression; he is independent of that. The will is everything, and he can express his will and he can withdraw his will. His position is such. Independent. His independence is of such quality and characteristic. Similarly, the highly powerful brāhmaṇs can give a curse such as one that will cause full forgetfulness—and they can withdraw it too."},{"class":"b44","text":" Karṇa went to Paraśurām disguised as a brāhmaṇ. Then Paraśurām taught him everything about weapons. One day Paraśurām went to sleep putting his head on the thigh of Karṇa. Indra, in the form of a worm, then pierced through the thigh of Karṇa and bit into the head of Paraśurām. Paraśurām started, “What is this?” Blood flowed and smeared over his body. Paraśurām then confronted Karṇa, “You are not a brāhmaṇ! A brāhmaṇ cannot tolerate like this; therefore, you must be a kṣatriya. Why have you come to me? You have taken all this education about weapons from me by falsehood. Therefore, I throw a curse that at the time of your greatest need you will forget everything.” He thereby withdrew all the learning he had given. Freewill is of such nature that it may sometimes give a commitment, but, if necessary, it may withdraw from all commitment."},{"class":"b51","text":" There are so many political heads of a nation who sometimes give commitments and try to oblige. They try to oblige, but, if necessary for the good, they may retract that and guide by ordinance. Similarly, the scriptures are something like that. The śāstras are written by the mahātmās who give instructions through the medium of so many symbols in the form of letters of the alphabet. That has some value, but that value is not to the same degree as we find in the writer; it is something less. Similarly, if the will, the centre from which the vibration is passing, is still in connection—i.e. if consent is there—it will work. Our Guru Mahārāj gave Hari-nām initiation to a man in Dhaka who was due to pass away within a few days. He spoke the mantra over the phone. His consent was there, so it was effective.

Now get up and take prasādam.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In this way Advaita Āchārya was pacified. Furthermore, we hear that sometimes Mahāprabhu showed Him honour due to His age.

Therefore, He constantly tried to show respect to Him. But Mahāprabhu did not allow, “What! You are senior. You are in the rank of My guardians, the rank of My parents. You should not show honour to Me. Rather, I am to show You honour.” He began forcibly taking the feet-dust of Advaita Āchārya who became distressed."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then Advaita Prabhu thought, “I have to make a plan so I can receive His punishment.” So, He went to His Shantipur house and began to preach jñāna-mārg showing that mukti is the highest end and bhakti is lower. “The principle of bhakti admits that God is fully independent. ‘We may try to please Him, but He may or may not be pleased; it is His will.’ So what is the necessity of wild-goose-chasing? God may or may not be propitiated and we may or may not get His grace; it is all uncertain. But mukti is in our hand. By certain practices we can enter into samādhi. Therefore, mukti is our real end and friend.

What is Your reason?” Mahāprabhu began to slap Him."},{"class":"b44","text":" Haridās Ṭhākur shuddered, “What is this?

Stop Your beating.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" But Advaita Āchārya came through smiling: “Now I have taken revenge on You. You always come to take My feet-dust. But now see!

Then only can he feel himself as humble: the master is the autocrat and the servant has no position. This is a matter of realisation and not a ‘mathematical’ truth. In connection with the autocrat he has no position, and if he accepts this naturally, not artificially, he will automatically be the humblest. The servant of an autocrat has no position and no ego whatsoever, and therefore he will possess natural humility, and that is his wealth. What sort of wealth is that?

To whom have you come to preach? And if there is no variety, then what is the necessity of preaching to those who are already one with you? Illusion also has its existence. Otherwise, why have you come to try to remove illusion?

The only way to get out of that disaster is to be reinstated in the idea of common guardianship, and that is to be effected by the true sādhus who have not deviated from God consciousness. With their help we have to appeal to the all-controlling agency. Then, we can again be reinstated in that echelon where we have our Master under whose holy feet we are to take shelter. If we can accept this, harmony will again be installed in our lives. So, we are always to be conscious of our Guardian, the highest harmoniser—and that is true God consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa’s two mothers, Yaśodā and Devakī, do not have an open relationship with each other. Kṛṣṇa’s foster mother, Yaśodā, is always afraid that Devakī and her husband, Vasudev, may come to claim Kṛṣṇa as their child. How can it be that this happens? Similarly, the members of Rādhārāṇī’s camp consider Chandrāvalī’s camp to be an anti-party to the main group of servitors. But the indirect section is always a necessary part of the Lord’s Pastimes. Chandrāvalī has more intellect, whereas Rādhārāṇī has more sentiment. Similarly, in all rasas (devotional mellows) there is harmony and also discord. Some opposition enhances the play of dedication."},{"class":"b44","text":" In sakhya-rasa (the mood of serving the Lord as a friend) when Kṛṣṇa began to play with His friends, the cowherd boys, there were two parties: one side with Kṛṣṇa and the other with His brother, Balarām. The cowherd boys were divided into two sections to represent opposite sides, and then they began to playfully fight. The punishment for whichever party would be defeated was that each was to carry a boy from the winning party on their shoulders. In this way a service-punishment was given."},{"class":"b44","text":" Balarām is very strong while on the opposing party Śrīdāmā is also very strong. In fact Śrīdāma came into Kṛṣṇa’s party because Kṛṣṇa is not as strong as Balarām. In this way their playing began. When the two parties fought, Balarām generally wouldn’t accept that He was defeated. Rather, His nature was that He would become enraged."},{"class":"b44","text":" Sometimes a demon would enter one of the parties by taking the form of a cowherd boy. In this manner Pralambāsura and Vyomāsura mixed with the play of the cowherd boys seeking an opportunity to take a boy on their shoulders and abduct him. One day, Pralambāsura carried Balarām into the depths of the jungle. But when Balarām came to understand that He was being carried by a demon impostor, He struck him with a great blow to the head. In this way the higher conception of truth runs in order to not only remove all difficulties—personified as demons—but to positively fill up the whole heart with sweet nectar. And the sweetest nectar is personified in Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" On another occasion, Kṛṣṇa was considering the case of another miscreant, Śiśupāl, and how he could be removed. For this purpose He convened a meeting between Himself, Balarām, and Uddhava, but Balarām opposed everything Kṛṣṇa said. Whenever Kṛṣṇa wanted a policy to be adopted, Balarām would object, “What is this policy? Just leave it to Me; I shall kill him outright! What need is there of all these politics? I don’t understand.” All the while Uddhava, who by nature is not partial to violence, tried to pacify Balarām. The example of enhancement of the beauty of the Lord’s Pastimes by discord and opposition is represented very cleverly in this story in an ornamental way."},{"class":"b44","text":" Musaladhara, a name of Balarām meaning ‘the wielder of the club-like weapon’, gives us a hint that He doesn’t delight in the finer mental level of intellect and politics. He likes to solve everything with the strike of His club. So, in Balarām we find less intelligence, but stronger force. Still, the greatest, most subtle opposing forces can only be harmonised by Kṛṣṇa. Harmony means to control opposite forces."},{"class":"b51","text":" Lord Rāmachandra expressed, “There is no greater friend than a brother to be found anywhere”, while His own brother, Lakṣmaṇ, instead stressed the opposite angle of vision: “The brother is the worst type of enemy because when he emerges from the mother’s womb, the elder brother can no longer suck her breast.

The nature of affection is not straightforward because it has to accommodate everything in it. Everything possible in existence is accommodated in love. Love means sacrifice to such a high degree that it can embrace everything. The movement of love is generally crooked, and, for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, it has been designed in this way by the Lord’s divine power, yogamāyā, in order to prevent any staleness or sterility from entering the Pastimes. So try to adjust to this. Don’t be eager to create another world."},{"class":"b44","text":" To do away with opposition, greater harmony is necessary. And in the higher type of harmony, opposition even enhances the beauty of that harmony and helps it. When harmony is successful, then it is found to be the necessity of beauty. Kṛṣṇa represents beauty, and His harmonising capacity supersedes everything. There is nothing He cannot harmonise, and all enemies become friends in that harmony. In so many ways this is to be accommodated.

That diversity and unity is all to satisfy His purpose.

My concentration is always there, but the standard of their service isn’t so exclusive as to give full satisfaction to Him properly. That is My objection. They rush forward to serve Kṛṣṇa but they do not know how to fully satisfy Him. Otherwise, I would allow them to.” In this way Rādhārāṇī’s statement justified Her feeling.

And his second attitude was to put a stop to all scholarly researchers and doctorates of different departments, and to stop their boasting research; and third, to minimise, to slacken, the grandeur of the worship of Nārāyaṇ. He caused the domain of love to descend into this plane with love from the heart as all-in-all.

Previously, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur had examined Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and was satisfied that he could represent the essential line of Śrī Gaurachandra, given by His true representative and follower, Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī. Now, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur gave the charge of that line to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj in a way that many senior godbrothers present described as a ‘mystic transmission’ of responsibility."},{"class":"b44","text":" After Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād departed from this world, his disciples sought out the association of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj.

After Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur left this world, many came to Nabadwīp to associate with Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. When we look to personalities like Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī or Śrīla Sanātan Goswāmī, we do not count the number of disciples they had or how many Temples they established.

For instance, if it be true that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj for reasons of his health, and to ultimately ‘percolate’ his high realisations, remained in his Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh in Nabadwīp, he ultimately counted on the presence of Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj, who he imbued with an indomitable spirit to go out and give his own high realisations to the whole world. We are ever seeing the magnanimous and benevolent nature of Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj, and we consider it to be synonymous with Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s desire to give the essential teachings of Mahāprabhu to the ever-expanding Gauḍīya–Vaiṣṇava world, who so much need them."},{"class":"b44","text":" Although superficially it may seem that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj remained apart in his Maṭh, actually it was not so. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj depended on Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj to assist him in his mission, was himself inspired by Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj to share his beautiful realisations with the world, and ultimately entrusted everything to the hands of his beloved disciple: his teachings, his Deities, his realisations, his Maṭh, his mission, his life, love, and inspiration."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj saw in Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj the qualities of one who could continue his mission and fully represent his deep realisations.

Śrīla Goswāmī Mahārāj’s expression was, “This year Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj cannot come. Every year he comes and blesses me with a further year of life, and by this blessing I am existing. Now I am thinking that next year I shall not be able to accept the pūjā of my disciples.” Such were the exalted feelings of Śrīla Goswāmī Mahārāj, and it happened that Śrīla Goswāmī Mahārāj disappeared that year and so was unable to attend his own next Guru-pūjā day."},{"class":"b44","text":" At the time when the Gauḍīya Maṭh was divided, devotees would generally not visit devotees of any other camp.

By age and by experience, in both ways, he is senior to me. I was fortunate to have his association since a very long time, perhaps in 1930, something like that.

Our relationship is very intimate.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Herein, we find the history of a transcendental relationship between these two pure devotees of the Lord. Addressing Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj as ‘His Divine Grace’ and ‘Om Viṣṇupād’—forms of address for one regarded as a spiritual master—Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj has transcended the norms of social etiquette and superficial formality. Intimately associating together for a concentrated period of over five years, often for five to seven hours daily, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj considered that “Kṛṣṇa and Prabhupād liked him to prepare me” for his future expansive missionary activities in the Western world. While remembering their intimate talks, specifically in regard to <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad</span> <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj recalls the depth in penetration of their discussions. “Once while discussing the verse <span class=\\"e3\\">dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena Mām upayānti te</span> [Bg: 10.10: “I give them the understanding by which they can come to Me.”] I submitted to him that here <span class=\\"e3\\">upayānti</span> is indicative of parakīya-rasa [paramour relationship].

The Bombay Gauḍīya Maṭh was established by Śrīdhar Mahārāj and myself. We made two parties for begging, collecting alms. Śrīdhar Mahārāj, myself, and Bhakti Sāraṅga Goswāmī Mahārāj.

The sannyāsī remarked, “They ask questions that cannot be answered.” Concerned, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj enquired further as to the nature of those questions. One after another Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj answered them all.

Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur was so pleased with the poem’s ontological depth and its happy style that he remarked, “Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur has written this through him. Now I am satisfied that although I may go, at least one man remains behind who can represent my conclusions.” In further appreciation of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s writings, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur informed the editors of the Gauḍīya Maṭh’s periodicals, “If you include articles written by Śrīdhar Mahārāj, the quality of your publications will be greatly improved.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" After the disappearance of Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur, the Gauḍīya Maṭh gradually diverged.

At that time, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj wrote a letter to a disciple saying, “Yesterday, we have all come to Nabadwīp Dhām. This place is an establishment of one of my godbrothers. It is a very nice and extensive place, and my godbrother B.R. Śrīdhar Mahārāj has spared one entire house for our stay. He has also agreed to cooperate with our society. We shall observe his birthday celebration, and the brahmachārīs shall learn how to celebrate the spiritual master’s birthday.” Shortly afterwards, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj asked Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj to be the president of his newly formed society—the International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" During the Vyāsa Pūjā celebration, one of Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj’s disciples saw Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj and Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj fully absorbed in a deep discussion in Bengali.

Concerned about his failing health, he had written Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj asking whether he should continue living in the United States or return to India to live his last days in Vṛndāvan.

He once wrote in a letter to one of his students, “Because you are my disciple, and I think, a sincere soul, it is my duty to refer you to someone who is competent to act as a Śikṣā-guru. For spiritual advancement of life, we must go to someone who is actually practising spiritual life. So, if you are actually serious to take instructions from a Śikṣā-guru, I can refer you to the one who is the most highly competent of all my godbrothers. This is B.R.

In his purports to the Ādi-līlā of <span class=\\"e3\\">Chaitanya-charitāmṛta</span>, he states: “One should know the instructing spiritual master to be the personality of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇadās Kavirāj Goswāmī states that there are two kinds of instructing spiritual masters. One is the liberated person fully absorbed in meditation in devotional service and the other is he who invokes the disciple’s spiritual consciousness by means of relevant instructions.

Otherwise, how I may have? So, I wish that Śrīdhar Mahārāj may bestow his blessings as he was doing always, and may Guru Mahārāj help me so I can do some service.

How he landed there in America, and the nature of his beginning the movement, his intense degree of dedication to Kṛṣṇa and dependence, and how much he made himself empty of any other desire than the order of his Gurudev—quite empty that Kṛṣṇa came down to help him, and it is corroborated that Kṛṣṇa worked on his behalf. In his poem, <span class=\\"e3\\">Prayer to the Lotus Feet of Kṛṣṇa</span>, we find him pleading with Kṛṣṇa, ‘My dear Brother, Your good fortune will come to You only when Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī becomes pleased with You.’ Seeing his Gurudev Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī as Rādhārāṇī’s delegation and his order as Her divine service, he humbly submitted that he did not feel himself worthy or fit to discharge the divine service, so he enlisted Kṛṣṇa in the service of his Guru. He had completely dedicated himself to the purpose, he was so earnest in his prayer to Kṛṣṇa that he may discharge the duty that he has been given by his Guru Maharaj, that divine force, power, came down to help him. Otherwise, it is impossible. It is not a thing of the ordinary level that anyone will do, but the highest thing has been taken down to the lowest position so extensively.

He said, ‘Because he can’t be converted.’”"},{"class":"b44","text":" And just twenty-four hours before his departure from this mortal world, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur called for his beloved disciple Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj and asked him to sing the song of Narottam Dās Ṭhākur: <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī-Rūpa-Mañjarī-pada</span> (the lotus feet of Rūpa Mañjarī are my treasure). Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj recalls: “So I did, hesitatingly. My nature is always hesitating, pushing back. Then, Kuñja Bābu asked me to stop. I was not a good singer, so as soon as he suggested, I stopped. Then, Kuñja Bābu asked Purī Mahārāj of Kalna, ‘You sing.’ So he began. Then, Śrīla Prabhupād was a little disturbed. ‘I don’t like to hear the sweet tune of the song’, he said. Then, he stopped, and I had to begin again with <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī-Rūpa-Mañjarī-pada, sei mora sampada</span>. He wanted me to sing that song. That is the fulfilment of life of everyone of us, to be Rūpānuga—followers of Śrī Rūpa.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Senior godbrothers who witnessed this exchange have described it as a ‘mystic transmission’ in which Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj was given admittance into the eternal entourage of Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī. Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s humble vision, however, is that he was posted as the gatekeeper, the guardian of devotion (bhakti-rakṣak), to protect the storehouse of conclusive truths about the full-fledged theistic conception of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, as given by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" Further expressing his appreciation for Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s ‘high realisations’ in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj says, “I want to take you everywhere. At least at the place we have in Māyāpur, people are coming from all over the world. Why don’t you stay there?” Sometimes it is wondered why Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj apparently did not take up Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj’s offer. Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj explains, “I said, ‘Of course I shall try to help you. Sometimes I shall go and stay there with you.’ But I really did not think at the time that I shall survive him.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Finally, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj refers to ‘that planetarium’. Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj is very fond of Sanātan Goswāmī’s most famous work, the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛtam</span>, in which devotees, devotional service, and Kṛṣṇa are described very scientifically. On the basis of this transcendental literature, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj had contemplated an elaborate preaching exhibition, showing graphically, with the use of dioramas depicting the varieties of material and spiritual planetary systems, how the ultimate spiritual destination is Kṛṣṇa’s own abode, Goloka Vṛndāvan. Due to insufficient funds, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj humbly submitted his idea to Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj, who approved saying, “It will be built under your direction.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" And just prior to his departure from this mortal world, Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj advised his senior disciples that in his absence, when the necessity arose to consult higher authority, that they should consult Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj."},{"class":"b44","text":" In conclusion, we humbly submit that the transcendental relationship between Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj and Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj be viewed and respected in terms of their eternal spiritual positions and long-standing appreciation and affection for one another."},{"class":"b52","text":" Since the departure of His Divine Grace A.C.

The title ‘Bhaṭṭāchārya’ was peculiar to the line when they predominantly performed and taught religious sacrifices and worship [paurohitya]. In the line, many were also brahminical spiritual masters with thousands of disciples. There were a number of professions adopted in the line, including farming and landownership. Sanskrit scholarship was predominant all through. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was aware that Śrīyukta Rāmdhan was a particularly outstanding scholar. The illustrious family line of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj originates with the sage called Rajarṣi Vātsya and is known as the Rajarṣi Vātsya Gotra. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s mother’s family lineage was also Bhaṭṭāchārya brāhmaṇ.

She dreamt that night that the Deity presented her with a beautiful baby. The baby was effulgent and his head was without hair. She thought, Śrīmatī Gaurī Devī has no issue, so in the dream she gave the baby to the hand of Śrīmatī Gaurī Devī. After some days, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj appeared, and lo—Śrīmatī Kumud Kāminī saw that the newly-born child was identical with the beautiful baby of her dream."},{"class":"b44","text":" He stayed at his maternal uncle’s house for his primary education at Khaithan Grām where he attended the local Pāṭhśālā [primary school] there.

Further, he would only eat what was given to him once. He wouldn’t accept anything a second time—because in his heart he offered everything to the Lord before eating."},{"class":"b44","text":" As a young lad, he unfailingly bathed every day in the sacred Ganges at Dampal. Rising early before sunrise, he would walk there daily, three miles and back. He would also pick some lotus flowers from a natural reservoir and offer them every day to the Ganges and Lord Śiva.

All three predictions came true. The name of the astrologer was Yogī Bīr Śrī Varadā Majumdār. He was the headmaster of the Lālgolā High School, seven stations down the line, about a two-hour train ride from Baharampur. That school was founded by a King by the name of Rājā Yogendra Nārāyaṇa Rāo, in the name of his father Rājā Mahendra Nārāyaṇa Rāo.

Yet, he passed his examinations, coming in the first division, while the student most diligent in his studies failed.

From childhood, however, despite the fact that he was born in a renowned smārta brāhmaṇ family, his natural mood of religious attraction was for the saṅkīrtan [congregational chanting of the Holy Name] of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b51","text":" Om Viṣṇupād Paramahaṁsa Śrī Śrīla Prabhupād Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Goswāmī [1874–1937] was the illustrious Founder-President of Śrī Chaitanya Maṭh with sixty-four branches all over India, known as Gauḍīya Maṭhs. He also established preaching missions abroad. Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, during his college studies, was deeply attracted to the divine life and precepts of Śrī Chaitanyadev, and as a result he first made contact with Śrīla Prabhupād in the Gauḍīya Maṭh, and he fully committed himself to the Mission in 1926. When Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj left home and joined the Mission, his Gurudev, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Goswāmī Prabhupād, was overjoyed, and he quoted the famous <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gītā</span> śloka in appreciation:"},{"class":"b81","text":" यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः ।<br />स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्त्तते ॥"},{"class":"b60","text":" yad yad ācharati śreṣṭas tat tad evetaro janaḥ<br />sa yat pramāṇaṁ kurute lokas tad anuvarttate"},{"class":"b43","text":" “The people follow the ways of the great.

In 1930, at the original Ultadanga Gauḍīya Maṭh, Śrīla Prabhupād Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Goswāmī ordained him in sannyās [monkhood], awarding him the tridaṇḍa-sannyās title of Śrīmad Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar, meaning ‘the Illustrious Guardian of Devotion’, because of his formidable scriptural command and natural, deep spiritual insight. Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj travelled extensively throughout the whole of India preaching fluently in Bengali, Hindi, Sanskrit, and English. His English carried an attractive sweetness and eloquence of a unique character. He successfully spread Lord Śrī Chaitanyadev’s message on mass levels such as various colleges and universities, and he conducted public seminars and saṅkīrtan festivals."},{"class":"b44","text":" Once when Śrīla Guru Mahārāj went to Giridih at Bihār, he delivered a lecture at the Barristers’ Library there.

Our ancestors were so, so great, and now we have fallen into such filthy garbage!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" On another occasion at Giridih, at a conference, the president of the conference, a learned scholar, one Mr. Basāk, remarked after hearing Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s speech, “We thought for so long now that Vaiṣṇava-dharma was a branch of Hindu religion. But today, Mahārāj, after what I have heard from you, with your sound argument and scriptural evidence, we know now that Vaiṣṇava-dharma is the original religion—the jaiva-dharma or religion of all souls—and all others are only the misconceived portion of the original.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In His Divine Grace Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s own words: “This must be deeply studied and considered by the learned section. The Vaiṣṇava-dharma that Mahāprabhu gave is the original Vaidika-dharma. What Śrīla Rāmānuja Āchārya and Śrīla Madhva Āchārya gave has completely merged into the line of Mahāprabhu. And what Lord Śaṅkar, Lord Buddha, and Ramakrishna Mission have given is all hodgepodge. One who can properly catch the gist of this is benefitted in the extreme.

The subject of his talk was ‘The Superexcellence of the Teachings of Śrī Chaitanya’. The president, in his introductory lecture, spoke the age-old dogma that all religions are one and the same. When Śrīla Guru Mahārāj took the stand to speak, he said:"},{"class":"b88","text":" “It is a very regrettable that I must first, in order to speak on my subject, announce that I completely disagree with the president.

And prayojan or the goal is prema, but not mukti [liberation]. Dharma, artha, kāma, mokṣa [religiosity, economy, material desire, and liberation]—these are not the goal.

And when I was in my maternal uncle’s house, for three years for early education in a primary school, I got some help from one of my aunts who taught me <span class=\\"e3\\">Rāmāyaṇa</span> and <span class=\\"e3\\">Mahābhārata</span>. That helped me a great deal. Already I had some affinity for all those things, some type of intuitive knowledge and partiality to ancient mythological teachings and culture of the orthodox section. From very childhood my tendency was with the culture of the orthodox section—Veda, Upaniṣad, etc., faith in God—all these things."},{"class":"b44","text":" At nine years I was admitted into high school [intermediate according to the current system in India]. As a student, there in the debating club I always sided with the ancient śāstric culture, even against the teachers that took up the cause of the renaissance or reformation. I was always on the side of the previous culture. I fought with them, and I don’t think they could defeat me. Then I got my sacred thread in the family tradition when I was fourteen years. I feel that my memory was more or less quite sharp. I could remember what I saw and heard in my early age."},{"class":"b44","text":" I am told that I had a general tendency that if anyone would come to ask me something, I would reply, “No.” Whatever would be asked of me, “No.” But once, when one of our family-members, a scholar, went to appear for his examination, he came to ask me whether he would pass or not. I pronounced, “Yes.” And he won a scholarship. Then I matriculated from the local high school when I was fifteen years of age. I could write Sanskrit verse before that."},{"class":"b44","text":" I like sacrifice in life. The magnanimous side. I had affinity for Lord Rāmchandra, for the model Pastimes, but not so much Lord Kṛṣṇa, because of His Vṛndāvan-līlā. I could not accommodate why God should be a liar and a girl-hunter. I could not accommodate this. Though I saw Rādhā-Govinda Mūrtis [Deities]—They seemed to be very, very charming. I found some mystic background there, but on the surface, I had more liking for Rāmchandra than Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" My attraction to Kṛṣṇa first came through <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, and then through Mahāprabhu. I liked Rāmchandra for His magnanimity. I was mainly attracted by the self-giving ideal. So I liked Rādhārāṇī very much, I liked Mahāprabhu very much, but my attraction to Kṛṣṇa was less. My attraction to Kṛṣṇa came through Mahāprabhu and through Rādhārāṇī—from Their side. When I was nine or ten or so, there was a Temple where Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities were installed in Jagadanandapur, near Katwa. Every year in Kārtik month my father used to read <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> there. Sometimes I visited that Temple with him, and I found some mystic atmosphere there. It seemed very mystical to me."},{"class":"b44","text":" After matriculation I went to Baharampur [District Mushirabad] for college study at the Krishnath College. There, with the company of one of my cousins, my maternal uncle’s son, I came into connection with the East Bengal people, who were renowned, we had heard, for their boldness and sacrificing nature. I took residence in the same hostel as them."},{"class":"b44","text":" Somehow, I had passed matriculation second division, [Śrīla Guru Mahārāj had suffered a very dangerous bout of malaria for a whole year at that time.—Ed.], but I passed IA [Intermediate Arts] in the first division. When we were studying in the local school, we had to do some family works along with our study. But now, from the hostel, I passed in the first division."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then I was again admitted in that same college at Baharampur. After the fourth year we sat for the examination of BA. When I was a student of the fourth year, I came into the connection of a younger boy who had just passed matriculation and was newly admitted into the college. In the college I found that there was a small section of students who were addicted to some meditation and pūjā, etc. And there was another group that did not care for worshipping, but they liked the service of patients and to do good for the public. But I have an internal nature for both."},{"class":"b44","text":" I was a fourth-year student and that boy was a first-year student—three years gap. I found that he was given to both sides very intensely; taking the Name of the Lord sometimes very loudly like a madman, and also doing sandhyā-vandana [regular morning, noon, and evening prayers and worship], etc. At the same time, when there was any patient, he would engage himself in their service, even neglecting to attend the college class. Both sides—social service as well as worship were combined in him."},{"class":"b44","text":" Before this, when I was in school, I got a book where it is mentioned that if we can go on with the japam [meditational chanting] of gāyatrī 432 times daily, we can achieve a very good spiritual improvement. I practised that for some time, and at that time I tried my best to understand the revealed truth—without consulting any dictionary or grammar; I had heard that gāyatrī is conscious, spiritual, not dead words. So, if I go on with japam, gāyatrī itself will express its meaning and purpose. I approached it with that attitude, and I used to feel some light coming from the words of gāyatrī itself; I had some knowledge about that for some time."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, as I said, I came in connection with that boy in college, and I tried to associate with him. His name was Śrī Sureś Bhaṭṭāchārya; he came from a brāhmaṇ family of Faridpur. The founder of the Bharat Sevashram, Śrī Praṇavānanda, was from his village. Śrīpād Madhusūdan Mahārāj also comes from the same village—Bajepratapur in the district of Faridpur."},{"class":"b44","text":" One day, when we two were going on a morning walk and also cleaning our teeth with small twigs, he referred to his father with the expression “that gentleman”. I took exception to that: “Why do you use this expression for your father? You say ‘that gentleman’. What is this!?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He said, “Yes, I have committed a wrong; I shouldn’t have spoken in this way before you. But really it is like that. ‘That gentleman’—he was a gentleman, and in this life I came to him, and he has protected me for some time, and in the next life I shall go to some other place; in this way we are moving hither and thither, coming to some gentleman and from there to another gentleman …”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Although I gave opposition, that point hit me very hard. I began to think, “Yes, it is true. We are in the midst of father, mother, brother, or, as he said, ‘that gentleman’. What real connection have I with them, or they with me? We are all almost like strangers!” Thinking and thinking on this point the whole world became as vacant. I felt a furious atmosphere, with no shelter to take anywhere. A chaotic position, and I have no position of stability. Wherefrom am I coming, where to go, how long am I to stay here—this is a point in the infinite. I am an uncertain point in the whole of the infinite. A great shock came to me in this way. And that was the great turn in my life."},{"class":"b44","text":" The worldly achievement has no value. I was studying, a fourth-year student. I was to appear in a few months for the final examination. My friends were alarmed at seeing my position. “What are you doing? You are neglecting your studies! How will you be able to pass? Your father is sending money [for your education]; you are not so rich.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In this way they tried their best to help me, but I couldn’t concentrate on any book of study. They said, “If you can’t do so, we shall read and you try to hear.” At that time, my friend gave me some literature on Mahāprabhu’s life and teachings, and I devoured it like nectar. I found some position there—it is not that I am nowhere. Here is the support—the basis, the foundation; I found here the sustenance, hope, and shelter I needed."},{"class":"b44","text":" In this way I began to read and read. My very nature was that whatever I read, I read scrutinisingly. It may be slow, but my reading is more or less very accurate and representing the true aspect. I could also hear very clearly. Even without reading, acute hearing was also a part of my nature . Whatever I heard, I could grasp the very purpose and keep it within me. And here also by thorough reading I found my life, my future hope, everything. I was converted. In my mother’s family there was some recognition of Śrī Chaitanyadev, but my paternal family were orthodox smārtas. They hated the followers of Chaitanyadev. Chaitanyadev has created a chaotic society. Pests that cannot keep their own stand in the social position—it is they who gather to follow Chaitanyadev. Those who have lost their social position become Vaiṣṇavas, and they say that they are followers of Chaitanya. In my father’s family they held such a hatred. But after this I became fully converted into a follower of Chaitanya. Such a feeling came in me, not only intellectually, but in heart and mind also. I underwent a wholesale conversion."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then my father died. He was disappointed and dejected. I was the eldest son; he had some hope in me for family matters, but when he saw such a change in me, it may be said that he died almost heartbroken. The burden of the family also came on my mind, but my state of mind was somewhere else. The chance came to me to lead a life of abnegation. For one year the son won’t use any umbrella or shoes. I made some extreme addition—I used nothing but one piece of cloth and a sheet for one year. And half-mad I used to do agriculture work and service to the cows. Anyway, I passed BA. The Baharampur section where I appeared, my classmates, said this was a wholesale massacre! Very few could pass, but somehow I passed. Some of my classmates said, “Oh, by the method of worshipping and satisfying God, he has passed! He did not study at all but he passed, only by worshipping God.” They said like this."},{"class":"b44","text":" When my father died, almost with full consciousness he passed away, he told several things to me. One was that I would have to marry. I had never uttered a lie. Whatever the effect, I strictly spoke the truth. But I couldn’t commit myself before him. So I felt pressured, “Whether you marry or not, don’t disturb me in this time of my death. Say that you will do it."},{"class":"b44","text":" Anyhow, the expression came from me, “I shall try to fulfil your request.” In this way, in a modified way, I answered him. Then anyhow, I had to marry. Married life continued for six years. In the meantime I went to study again in the law class. But the Gandhi movement of non-cooperation came forward, and I joined the movement because there was some sort of promise that ‘within one year I shall give svarāj [independence] to you.’ I wanted to become a sannyāsī, but the countrymen want one year, so I thought I must sacrifice this for them. I left law college and worked for some time posted as a secretary of the movement here in Kalna. In this way and sometimes in the village for two or three years. Then it was stopped for some time, and later I was wanted for service in Kolkata. With the help of a government office superintendent I got some vocation, and I put up in Kolkata. I attended the office there."},{"class":"b44","text":" My attraction stays always towards Mahāprabhu. In the meantime I wandered here and there searching for a sādhu from whom to take initiation. But I couldn’t select anyone to my taste or satisfaction."},{"class":"b44","text":" One day, I was returning from the office, and I found a placard in Chittaranjan Avenue: Gauḍīya Maṭh Mahotsav [Grand Festival] for one month. The address was given, near the Pareśnāth Temple. I found this red-coloured placard. I thought, Gauḍīya Maṭh must be Mahāprabhu’s followers, let us go and see what is there. When I was a law student, through Sureś Bhaṭṭāchārya I knew the founder of Bharat Sevashram, Śrī Praṇavānanda, and he tried his best to take me into his mission, but I flatly refused."},{"class":"b44","text":" “My head is sold to Mahāprabhu, Gaurāṅga, so I can’t go anywhere else.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He said, “I also have great reverence for Mahāprabhu Chaitanyadev, but I think the first stage must be Buddhistic abnegation or vairāgya and indifference [to the world]. Second, Śaṅkar’s Vedānta or jñān. And the last and highest will be Chaitanya’s prema. Otherwise, people will misunderstand that prema for lust.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" I replied, “Yes, what you say is all right—that Śrī Chaitanyadev’s prema-dharma is the highest, above the Buddhistic and Śaṅkarite conceptions of theism. But Chaitanyadev has not told us, ‘Go to the Buddhists and practice vairāgya, and then go to Śaṅkar and have knowledge of the Vedānta, and then come to Me.’ He has told that ‘wherever you are, take the association of a sādhu and you can take the Name.’ ”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He was silenced."},{"class":"b44","text":" I said to him, “If you have got any supernatural power, I will be grateful if you can say where my spiritual guide, my Gurudev, is.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" But he took the name of some gentleman, Haranāth. I went to search for him but could not find him. But this was when I found that placard and went to Gauḍīya Maṭh. There I found only one gentleman manning the outside hall, and the rest had all gone on procession of nagar-saṅkīrtan [congregational chanting in the town]. Then I had a little talk with that gentleman. I had studied somewhat about Chaitanyadev and other scriptures, but I found that these people representing the Maṭh had deeper and more sound knowledge than I. Then, the party came back from nagar-saṅkīrtan, and I found Guru Mahārāj in front with his daṇḍa [mendicant’s staff]. As soon as he reached in front of the Maṭh, some disciple came and took the daṇḍa from him, and gradually he was received there."},{"class":"b44","text":" At first sight, I found Guru Mahārāj’s attitude was that of complete indifference to the ordinary world. He does not care for anyone; he is self-sufficient. I got that sort of impression from his first sight. Then I began visiting. Gradually, I came to realise that I wanted to stay in such company."},{"class":"b44","text":" Unfortunately, I had been unable to find it before, but now the thought came to me, what’s to stop me coming and staying here? I cast my glance homeward—father gone, mother living, three younger brothers—they won’t be much affected. But my wife will be affected. I don’t know why, but a sudden thought came in my mind that if she dies, I am free. This thought came. I was attracted by that association. There were so many members of gentlemanly and educated nature, and wholly given to the service of Mahāprabhu. That attracted me most."},{"class":"b44","text":" And it was that very day, I came to my quarter and found that my wife was ill. I came home that night, and after three days she passed away. My mother tried to have me married again, but she could not do so. And within six months she also disappeared in Haridwar at the time of the Kumbha Melā. She died there. One of my brothers, Satyen, was attending her with other pilgrims and sisters, etc."},{"class":"b44","text":" I was free. I was visiting the Maṭh. I was thinking that I must cast my faith here, so I thought it necessary to know as much as possible about the mission, and to know the mission means to know the leader of the mission. So, I tried to go upstairs to where Guru Mahārāj stayed. I would go in front of his room and sit there to hear because I was thinking I shall join here. Then one day, it so occurred that Kīrtanānanda Prabhu, one brahmachārī, stopped me when I was making an attempt to go upstairs."},{"class":"b44","text":" “Where are you going?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “I’m going to Guru Mahārāj. I like it very much [to hear and associate].”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “No, never. You must stay here in the waiting room, and when you find anyone, you will inform him who you want to meet. He will check, and when he returns with the answer, you can go. Otherwise, you must stay here. Never cross this threshold.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" A little harsh. Then I thought, “What should be the considerate nature of the sādhus? Why should there be any difference outwardly and inwardly? So, I need not come here again!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" But at that very moment the position of Śukadev appeared in my mind. I had read in <span class=\\"e3\\">Mahābhārata</span> that Śrīla Vyāsadev sent Śrīla Śukadev Goswāmī to Rajarṣi Janaka to finish his education or sādhana. Śrīla Śukadev came, and he was detained for seven days at the outer gate. Then information went to Janaka, who sanctioned, “Allow him to pass the gate.” The next gate, he was again detained. In this way, there were seven boundaries of the capital, and at each of the seven gates he was detained for seven days. So, seven times seven means forty-nine days he was detained, and only then he could meet Janaka. This thought came in my mind. And then the next concluding thought came, “If there is anything bad here, and they take me and put me onto a throne to worship me, I should not come here, and if there is real good, and they beat with a broomstick, I must not leave!” That conclusion came in my mind, and I kept visiting."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then one day, Guru Mahārāj was strolling on the roof just after having taken his afternoon food. Generally, he did not take any food at night. I just approached, and took my stand in a corner. One man was attending him. Guru Mahārāj asked, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Ye kona vaktavya</span>—Has he something to say?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The attending person came and asked me, “Have you something to say?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “No. I have nothing to say.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He went back. “He says he has nothing to say.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then Guru Mahārāj said, “He has something to ask?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He again came to me, and said, “Guru Mahārāj said, have you got something to ask?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “No, I have nothing to ask.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He again returned to Guru Mahārāj. “He says he has nothing to ask.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then again Guru Mahārāj put, “He has got some purpose in mind for coming here.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The person returned to me. I said, “Yes, without purpose no incident can happen. When I have come, I have some purpose.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “What purpose?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “To gain the grace of you all.” That was my answer. “<span class=\\"e3\\">Āpānara prasannatā</span>.” Nothing else but that."},{"class":"b44","text":" Perhaps that touched Guru Mahārāj. He approached me and enquired from me who I was, what I did, where was my home, and so on. And then he said, “Yes, you are fortunate. You are born in the area of Gauḍa Maṇḍal.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" They had one booklet printed then and the attending person said, “Guru Mahārāj is offering this booklet to you.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" I said, “I already have it.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He said, “That does not matter. With his good will he is giving this to you, so it is something else. You take it.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then I took it on my head and accepted it. That was the first talk with Guru Mahārāj."},{"class":"b44","text":" The following year I was invited to Śrīman Mahāprabhu’s appearance ceremony at Māyāpur. At that time I was visiting the Maṭh and hearing. I went there for the ceremony. At that time my mother was also inviting me to the village Gumo where she was staying with my second brother. She wanted to see me before going to Haridwar, and the Gauḍīya Maṭh people were also inviting me to Māyāpur. I was in a dilemma."},{"class":"b44","text":" What to do? It was my mother’s call—and maybe the last. She might not live; her health was not good. This was the call. And I thought, I want to take this side in my life, so this side must be given preference. That is, I avoided the call of my mother to see her, and I went to the Gauḍīya Maṭh instead."},{"class":"b44","text":" From their talks in general, I found that they do not care for the opinion of anyone else, but when anything is quoted from scripture, they give a patient hearing. This was their nature. Summarily, they reject all, they don’t care for anyone, but they care only for scriptural truth; that they soberly consider and evaluate. But with abhorrence they reject so many stalwarts of the then society—this Aurobindo, this Gandhi, this Ramakrishna, the [imitationist] goswāmīs—they summarily reject them all. But Mahāprabhu, <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Gītā</span>—they are all-in-all. I had an attraction, a taste for them. I could identify with them."},{"class":"b44","text":" Still, there was some sort of objection. One was that Guru Mahārāj comes from a kāyastha family, that is considered śūdra, and I come from a brāhmaṇ paṇḍits’ family of great honour in the society. Ostensibly, any brāhmaṇ should have been suitable; in this way some sort of objection was felt in me. Then, when I went to Māyāpur, I again saw many things that touched me."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Prabhupād was delivering a lecture to so many gentlemen who had come from Krishnanagar—educated persons. In another place the elderly Śrīpād Bhakti Pradīp Tīrtha Mahārāj was giving a lecture. Somewhere else Śrīpād Bhakti Svarūp Parvat Mahārāj was found writing receipts, collecting funds from the people. It was a hive of activity. I felt a transcendental, happy atmosphere there."},{"class":"b44","text":" When the celebration was over, Guru Mahārāj was sitting in a canvas chair on the veranda of his room, and many persons were offering him obeisances and going home. At that time he was speaking, giving some discourse. I was always very eager to hear him. He was saying, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Āpānara āmāke vañchanā karibena nā</span>: don’t cheat me, you people.” I was alert. What? Where was the question of cheating him? Why cheating?! Everyone was invited, they came, and now they are leaving; what was his point about ‘cheating’?"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then the next thing he said was, “You all came with the understanding that you will engage yourselves in the service of Kṛṣṇa, and so I have entered into some relationship with you. And now, only as a fashion, you have attended this ceremony and you are going home to engage yourselves in worldly affairs; but your assurance to me was that you would all serve Kṛṣṇa, but … disappointed …” Then he continued, “You may say, ‘Oh, I have got some important business and after finishing this I shall come and join you as soon as possible’, but no, no! If you tell me there is just a little fire and after extinguishing the fire you will return, then I say that is also not necessary. <span class=\\"e3\\">If fire burns the whole world, you do not lose anything.</span> Rather, you are spared if you can disconnect from those things that are burnt. All your positive engagement, your inner hankering, has corresponding things in Kṛṣṇa. <span class=\\"e3\\">All your necessities and hankering will be satisfied in the service of the holy lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and nowhere else</span>.” He was speaking so forcefully."},{"class":"b44","text":" I was wonderstruck. I thought, “I would never hear anywhere in this living world such intense necessity for Kṛṣṇa-bhajan—so I must throw my head here.” It was then that I took the decision that I must be a disciple here."},{"class":"b44","text":" Before my mother died she had had some apprehension that, “He is my eldest son, but he will become a sannyāsī without completing my śrāddha ceremony [last rites]; then who will do my śrāddha ceremony?” So, when she passed, I went home and completed her śrāddha, and after finishing that, I came, in the last part of April, to join the Maṭh."},{"class":"b44","text":" At first, I said that my two younger brothers would finish their studies and take to their vocations, and then I would come away [from the family and join]. But Śrīpād Bhāratī Mahārāj and others said that I had a great opportunity. They pressed, “No, no! Kṛṣṇa has taken your wife, and Kṛṣṇa has taken your mother. He has done enough for you. Really if you neglect to avail yourself of this chance, perhaps some other obstacle will come and this life will be spoiled with no hope.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" I asked, “What are you saying?” They said, “Come immediately.” I took that advice and joined immediately. I was living together with my two brothers in a hostel, and they came with me. They went back crying; I remained in the Maṭh."},{"class":"b44","text":" I stayed at the Kolkata Maṭh for some time. I was requested to do some service in the press there, but I was not particularly inspired by the press work of proofreading, etc. I had much liking for the preaching—to go on kīrtan and preach. So, I was next sent on a preaching tour."},{"class":"b44","text":" The first stop was at the Dumurkondā Maṭh [in Bengal] and from there to Benares, then to Vṛndāvan. There, there was nagar-kīrtan for some time, then I was taken to Delhi where there was door-to-door collection for some time. Then Kurukṣetra Maṭh was established, and I was made Maṭh commander there, and then I was alone. A small villagetown and the place of Kurukṣetra. That is a solitary place except for during the solar eclipse when there is a great rush of hundreds of thousands of people. Doing collection, I passed about two or three years there. Then the Delhi Maṭh was founded, and I was in charge there. Then I visited Simla and other places for preaching."},{"class":"b44","text":" Every year in August we had to come back to the Kolkata Maṭh celebration for one month. So, when I came back here I was taken by Śrīpād Bhakti Hṛday Bon Mahārāj and Śrī Hayagrīva Prabhu [later Śrīpād Bhakti Dayita Mādhav Mahārāj] in a party towards Madras side, installing the footprints of Mahāprabhu. Then again upon returning, the Bag Bazaar Maṭh was opened, and from the original rented house in Ulṭā Ḍāṅgā the Deities were moved in procession in a chariot to Bag Bazaar Maṭh, and a one-month festival was held there. After that Prabhupād went on that year establishing and installing those pāda-pīṭha [footprints of Mahāprabhu] up to Mangalgiri, near Bejoyda, Kovvur, and so on."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then he went to Madras and declared the opening of Madras Gauḍīya Maṭh and put us there. We rented a house. Śrīpād Bon Mahārāj was the leader, and the senior sannyāsī. In the meantime I was given sannyās, recommended by Śrīpād Bon Mahārāj. He said about me, “He can preach well; he’s a good preacher rather than a canvasser.” I had a BA, and I was known as Śrī Rāmendrasundar Bhaṭṭāchārya, BA. My duty was to approach the people and introduce the sannyāsīs, and more or less I had the work of a canvasser. But Śrīpād Bon Mahārāj said, “He’s not a good canvasser, but a good preacher. He can speak Hari-kathā very well.” Then I was given sannyās in October 1930, and after installing footprints of Mahāprabhu one by one in various places, Prabhupād opened the Maṭh in Madras [as abovementioned], and we were left there and began preaching for three years or so."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then there was Vṛndāvan parikramā, circumambulation of the whole of Vṛndāvan. We joined that programme, and then Śrīpād Bon Mahārāj went to England for preaching, and I was in charge of Madras Maṭh. The Temple was constructed almost in my time. Later, Bombay Maṭh was opened, and I was again taken there. I lived there for some time and later was taken with the general party with Prabhupād. Staying most of the time with Prabhupād, we preached in different places of Bengal. At 5.30 a.m. on 1 January 1937, Prabhupād left the world."},{"class":"b44","text":" Before this, Prabhupād had wanted me to go for preaching to London, but I said, “I am not fit for this—I can’t follow their accent, and I don’t have the tendency to mix with them very closely. So, you will spend money to send me, but I won’t be able to show any satisfactory result. Of course, if you order me, I must go, but I am just informing you what I am.” Then he sent Śrīyukta A. B. Goswāmī Prabhu [later Śrīpād Bhakti Sāraṅga Goswāmī Mahārāj] instead of me."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Prabhupād become ill, I attended his sickbed. Just one day before his departure he called for me, and he asked me to chant <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī-Rūpa-Mañjarī-pada</span>. At that time I was not accustomed to leading the kīrtan. I was hesitating—Śrīyukta Kuñja Bābu, later Śrīpād Bhakti Vilās Tīrtha Mahārāj, asked one brahmachārī Prabhu, “You go on singing.” Then he began singing, but Prabhupād felt dissatisfaction. He said, “I don’t want to hear the tone or sweet sound. Then that brahmachārī prabhu stopped, and I had to sing <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī-Rūpa-Mañjarī-pada</span>. And the others said, “Prabhupād has hereby given you admission to the rasa-sevā section.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" About one year before this, I composed a Sanskrit poem about Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, and Śrīla Prabhupād was very happy with this.

I wanted to help him by Sanskrit education, etc., but they could not tolerate that, and they gave a proposal that we must prepare a deed.

I can’t accept this.” They began to revolt and disturb. There was a compromise. Śrīpād Goswāmī Mahārāj and Śrīpād Mādhav Mahārāj came. There was about five thousand rupees in the bank, and another seven thousand or so was to be paid to them, and then I would be here with absolute proprietorship. Śrīpād Goswāmī Mahārāj came to my help; he gave a loan of four thousand, and Śrīpād Jājāvar Mahārāj and others collected some funds from different parts, then seven thousand was given up, and then from that time I am here.

You have quality and capacity to preach Mahāprabhu’s teachings, especially to the educated section, but you do not do so.” Whenever he came, he would always charge me.

Sādhu and śāstra are our two friends everywhere."},{"class":"b44","text":" My Guru Mahārāj, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād, one day explained what is a sādhu, and what is karma. He then proceeded to explain that if a sādhu orders, “Bring me a flower”, but when you bring the flower he says, “No, now bring me some water”, and you object, “No, you ordered a flower and I brought it. Please accept this flower.” That will be karma."},{"class":"b44","text":" The sādhu is free. To thrust upon him his previous desire will be karma. At every moment he is free, so to follow his past will, will be karma. Always you are to be expectant for the immediate need."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the battlefield, if the general orders the army, “March this side”, then after noticing the circumstances to have changed, he says, “No, go this other way!” Then it won’t do for the soldiers to object by saying, “No! You have already ordered us to go in this direction.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Similarly, the sādhu and Guru are always free, and their order should be taken in such a way. It is not that we shall stick firmly to their first order, but they are living and independent."},{"class":"b44","text":" On being asked to do a particular service, one disciple told our Guru Mahārāj, “I need to know my programme of what to do at least one week in advance.” But Śrīla Prabhupād replied, “But I received the order only five minutes ago, so how could I inform you earlier?” So, it is not a dead matter."},{"class":"b44","text":" Of course, the beginners will not be able to accept that. They will receive their specific instructions just as a young boy is given the duty to every day practise writing the alphabet, “A B C … ”. That is a particular stage, but then he will be taught how to spell by using those letters in a certain way. And presently at every moment he will be using the letters in many ways according to the necessity of writing. The order may come to take down a dictation, to write this and that. Just repeating “A B C … ” is not sufficient."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, in the beginning of devotional life the student is asked, “Do this thing. Do that thing.” But when he will come in connection within the living substance, he will be prepared in such a way for a new order to come, and he will have to follow that with all alertness."},{"class":"b44","text":" When I was in Vṛndāvan, I had a desire to meet with one sādhu who was the most famous and respected siddha-bābājī of that place. I had the chance to stay with him for a few days, but my Śrīla Prabhupād, after circumambulating Vraja Maṇḍal, told me he was a kaniṣṭha-adhikārī. He explained that this bābājī was only copying as a student what are accepted as the practices of a sādhu. He was following the stereotyped direction. He was chanting the Lord’s Names, doing mādhukarī, fasting, reading <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, and performing the various formal duties recommended for the beginners, but he was not coming in contact with the living thing. He was simply undergoing training. He was simply following the training period."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the armed forces when the new recruits are in the training period, they are asked to do something repeatedly, “Do this! Do this! Do this!” So, they engage themselves in that way."},{"class":"b44","text":" The kaniṣṭha-adhikārī does not know the spirit and therefore cannot connect with the living substance. He, therefore, is in the preparatory life of a devotee, and he will repeatedly engage in those practices."},{"class":"b44","text":" Anyhow, I had already gone to see this bābājī two or three times in the evening. I sat there silently. He had many disciples there who respected him, with two or four staying by his side. Nobody said anything to me, and he could not tell that I was from the Gauḍīya Maṭh. I tried my best to read him."},{"class":"b44","text":" On one occasion that I saw him, it was the holy Nṛsiṁha Chaturdaśī day, and a reading from <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> was begun. He recited and sometimes he spoke about various things. I continued my watch over his activities, movements, etc. As I watched him, it was sometimes as if I was noticing Guru Mahārāj indicating to me that bābājī’s nature."},{"class":"b44","text":" After two or three days I came up with the conclusion that this man was trying his best from this plane to go up. But our Guru Mahārāj has come down from there and has a living programme with a purpose to fulfil. He does not belong to this world, but he has come from the spiritual world with some order. Our Guru Mahārāj has come down with something positive to give to the world. He has some order and plan: “Go and do this!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" But that bābājī was trying his best to follow what has been recommended in the scriptures. We can read about Rūpa, Sanātan, and others and accordingly have some idea and try to practise that. But that is theoretical practising: “This has been recommended, let me practise all these things, and then I will get my desired result.” One who follows in this way is a kaniṣṭha-adhikārī. But the desired end and living result will come by working under the direction of Gurudev and sādhu who are already members of that plane. And that is not theoretical, but practical. The difference is there in the practical necessity."},{"class":"b44","text":" In this way I had also come to the conclusion, later to be confirmed by Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, that this bābājī was a kaniṣṭha-adhikārī."},{"class":"b44","text":" Soldiers are sometimes ordered to do ordinary things—not only fighting but also shovelling, clearing jungle, and many other duties. When marching against the enemy, whatever duty will come in their front, they are to do that. The circumstances are practical and living. It is not mock-fighting, but a real fight, and at every moment they are not always fighting. The preparation to a fight has more value than fighting in a mock-fight during a training period, even though the mock-fight seems like real fighting."},{"class":"b44","text":" When the soldiers in the actual field find it necessary to do some other duties such as clearing the jungle, making a bridge, or a path, etc., that will have more value than a practice fight in peaceful circumstances."},{"class":"b52","text":" Of course the position of the general—of the Gurudev—is all-important; he must be real, not a sham or imitation. If the sādhu or Gurudev is genuine, to clean up his stool and urine may fetch more than worshipping the Deity. That is because such activity has a practical connection. So, under the guidance of a real Āchārya, whatever we do—whether it be cooking, looking after the cows, personal service, or so many other duties—that will have more value than my independent reading of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>. That is possible because the Āchārya is actually leading spiritual life and he has his mission to do, and if we can help him, that will fetch some higher result for us. And I will be paid by his coin, and not by any gross thing."}]}]}')}}]);
