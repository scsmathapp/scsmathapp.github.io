between 1981-87 at Śrī Caitanya Sāraswat Maṭh in Śrī Nabadwīp Dhām, West Bengal. The reader will quickly discover that he is hearing from a highly spiritually-realized soul about a subject which seems beyond the compass of ‘everyday’ matters but yet which is of quintessential importance to every living being in the human form. For those fortunate souls exclusively interested in the dedicated aspiration for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness, Śrīla B.R. Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj was, and is, an undisputed king—the ‘Emperor of Sannyasi Kings’. He was sought out by many both for his unique representation of the science of Kṛṣṇa Consciousness, and the uplifting effect of his personal association; in him, these two were synonymous."},{"class":"b44","text":" Several books extracted from the many hours of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s recorded informal talks have already been presented to the public. This Divine Aspiration continues the series. Perhaps, however, the subject matter selected here addresses the more practical concerns of the spiritual aspirant (for example, the chapter “Worship of the Pure Heart”), as well as focusing on the progressive awakening of his inner consciousness through the process of selection and elimination, a favorite essential theme of His Divine Grace (see ‘Gradations of Theism’)."},{"class":"b44","text":" Man’s needs are essentially simple, but his desires are complex. It is in these desires that he becomes entangled and loses sight of his life’s true purpose. The adage of saints and sages of all traditions has always been “simple living and high thinking”. This has never shown itself to be more true than in the present day of global uncertainty: surrounded as man is by his self-created ghosts of pollution, war, epidemic and so on. In these talks we are reminded again by a great Spiritual Master that the solution lies not in any partial attempt, whether social, economic, religious or otherwise, but in nothing less than reestablishing our relationship with the Supreme Being Himself. If this appears beyond the reach of most of us, then His Divine Grace also assures us that we can receive the most substantial guidance in our attempt through an affectionate serving-association with a living saint who has already traveled this path."},{"class":"b44","text":" For the dedicated followers of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, such an opportunity has mercifully been provided, in the form of His Divine Grace’s beloved disciple and appointed Successor-Ācārya, Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj, who is travelling the globe tirelessly, enlightening and nourishing devotees and spiritual seekers with his affectionate association. To him this book is respectfully dedicated."},{"class":"b69","text":" This attempt would not have been possible without the help of many good friends and helpers. I would like to express my appreciation to those who assisted me through its various stages, especially: Śrīman Mahānanda Prabhu, Mohita Kṛṣṇa Prabhu, Munīndra Mohan Prabhu, Śyāmasundara Prabhu, Kṛṣṇa-kāntā devi, Ananda-tirtha Prabhu and Vrajavanesvari devi, Vinode Bihari Prabhu, and Devasvarupa Prabhu.

The <span class=\\"e3\\">nāma,</span> the Lord’s Name, and the Lord whose Name it is are one and the same; that is enough. It is sufficient, complete. In the mundane world to help us we can sometimes accept the <span class=\\"e3\\">kavacas</span>, but that is not of very great importance.

To see or to look for other things to help it may be allowed to a certain extent. But not much attention should be given to those external things; they are only something like a <span class=\\"e3\\">varṇa,</span> a kind of dress, a covering for protection. So, there is not much harm if we take <span class=\\"e3\\">kṛṣṇa-kavaca</span> or <span class=\\"e3\\">narasiṁha-kavaca</span> with this intention: “It has come to help my <span class=\\"e3\\">nāma-bhajan</span> life.” If meant in this way, it may be allowed, but it is not the highest standard."},{"class":"b44","text":" The general purpose of using the <span class=\\"e3\\">kavaca</span> is to protect us from the external or superficial difficulties. But the pure devotees of Kṛṣṇa, they won’t be afraid of any external difficulties. Rather, they may invite them like Queen Kuntī, who said: “External dangers—let them come and attack me. I don’t care for them; I shall go on with my service.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" In using the <span class=\\"e3\\">kavaca</span> there is some <span class=\\"e3\\">karmic</span> connection, but if that is to help the good, then its use may be acceptable. Still, in the highest form of <span class=\\"e3\\">bhajan,</span> everything is depending on His will. The devotee thinks, “Whether I may be in danger or in happiness, I shall go on with my <span class=\\"e3\\">nāma-bhajan</span> without any care for the external conditions that may come to me according to my previous <span class=\\"e3\\">karma</span>. I may be in hell, heaven or anywhere else; I won’t waste my energy going to any other direction. I will go on with <span class=\\"e3\\">nāma-bhajan.” Bhajan</span> done in this mood is of the higher quality.

If it is necessary for Your sweet enjoyment to kill me, You can do that. I am a slave and You have every right over me, to do anything and everything.” With this conception in the background we have to make our approach towards Him, and that will be of the highest quality.

The whole concentration will be: “How can I satisfy You?”"},{"class":"b70","text":" Highest Ideal"},{"class":"b43","text":" Whatever troubles may come upon us we must not deviate our attention from that main purpose to any of those external things. The quality and intensity of our <span class=\\"e3\\">bhajan</span> will be less if we are very eager to maintain our safety as we are proceeding on the path of our devotional life. Such concerns should be uncared for as much as possible, and our only concern should be: “I want Your satisfaction.” And in that attempt, one must be self-forgetful as much as possible."},{"class":"b51","text":" But according to their <span class=\\"e3\\">adhikāra,</span> capacity, the practitioners may sometimes take the help of some protection on their way. That may be tolerated, but to seek protection on the path in this way is not the ideal. “I am going to You; please protect me on my way, please manage for me, for my protection.” Our fundamental attitude should not be such. But rather, we should think: “Whatever comes to me, it is Your sweet will; I won’t pray for protection.”"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Student:</span> I have another question connected to this. I am studying Indian Vedic astrology. In my studies I have made some astrological charts for devotees. I see the natal chart is like a photograph of the <span class=\\"e3\\">karma</span> of the person. So my question is: what is the use of astrology for a devotee, or in devotional service? Does it have some use?"},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj:</span> Just as general education, money, learning, physical health and other things are necessary for the purpose of preaching, so may be knowledge of astrology in a particular situation. But all such items are subsidiary; they are not the all-important thing. Generally, the public is attracted by the astrological statement, so it may be used like bait to capture people, so as to gradually convert them. Just as one devotee when asked by Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj Prabhupād to go to China to preach, said: “I shall go there and open a hostel; in this way, men will come, and I shall capture them for Kṛṣṇa’s service!” This is, in itself, not <span class=\\"e3\\">śuddha-bhakti, </span>pure devotion, but it is <span class=\\"e3\\">ānukūlasya-saṅkalpāh,</span> it may be favorable for the cause. Nāmācārya Haridās Ṭhākur used to give sweets to the children, and then ask them “Take the Name, the Name of the Lord, Kṛṣṇa. Say Kṛṣṇa!” First he is distributing sweets and then telling them “Say Kṛṣṇa!” It is a strategy like that."},{"class":"b69","text":" So, astrology may be utilized to create some confidence in the general public so that they will think: “This man is first-class, so I should be as a disciple to him.” In this way they may be taken gradually towards the real path. Such an approach is <span class=\\"e3\\">ānukūlasya-saṅkalpāh;</span> it may be <span class=\\"e3\\">ānukūla</span>, a favourable step towards devotion proper.

For example, someone may be taking food only once in a day; or even he may not be using any clothes. In all such matters he is indifferent. <span class=\\"e3\\">‘Virāg’ </span>means indifference to everything in this world; but that also is not intrinsically a part of devotion.

So, in the case of religion, or theism, India was selected by God to be in the central or highest position. It is not unreasonable: a university college cannot be established in every village, but some particular place must be selected for it. It is the same for the hospital, the police station, and so on.

Or do you want to be with Śiva, with his friends or his servants, like Nandi and Bṛngi? Do you want to become one of them? Do you want to become four-handed, like the servitors of Nārāyaṇa?

The human birth is rarely attained, and if you avoid this chance to approach the divine realm through it, you commit suicide. It is not a small mistake you are committing; it is the greatest mistake if you lose this chance— it amounts to no less than suicide. So try for that highest plane. If you lose this birth, there is no guarantee that again you will get a human birth. You may have to take birth as other species of life. Remember the case of Bharat Mahārāj! At the time of his death, he had some intense attention for a deer-cub, to whom he had given shelter after it became separated from its mother. He was lamenting, “Oh, who will look after this young one?” In his next birth he became a deer. Such a horrible thing that the impression of the young deer caught him and took such a shape.

This is My heartfelt appeal to you, Oh My friends.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" Don’t Cheat Me"},{"class":"b43","text":" In our time we have seen that our Guru Mahārāj Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur also preached with so much force, so much urgency. Once he was present at a <span class=\\"e3\\">mahotsava,</span> a big festival, in Mayapur. When the celebration was over, Guru Mahārāj was sitting in a canvas chair on the verandah of his room; many people were coming before him, offering him obeisances and then leaving for their homes. I was always very eager to hear him, and I was present at that time. He was saying, “Don’t cheat me, you people.” I thought, “Why does he say that? Where is the question of cheating him? Everyone was invited to this festival; they came, and now they are leaving. What is his point about cheating?” But the next thing he said was, “You all came with the understanding that you will engage yourselves in the service of Kṛṣṇa, and so I have entered into some relationship with you. And now, after attending this ceremony, only as a show, you are going home to engage yourselves in worldly affairs. But your assurance to me was that you would all serve Kṛṣṇa.” In this way he showed some disappointment."},{"class":"b69","text":" Then he continued, “You may say, ‘Oh, there will only be a little delay, I have got some important business, and after finishing that, I shall come back and join you as soon as possible.’ But I say, no, no! Even if you tell me there is a fire, and after extinguishing the fire you will return, then I will say that is also not necessary. There is no necessity of extinguishing the fire. It may burn the whole world—it does not do any harm to you. You do not lose anything; rather, you will be saved if that burnt world leaves your mind. All your inner necessities are met only at the holy feet of Kṛṣṇa. None can satisfy your inner hankering but Kṛṣṇa, <span class=\\"e3\\">akhila rasāmṛta-mūrti, </span>the reservoir of all sweetness, all the <span class=\\"e3\\">rasa.</span> Everything sweet you are aspiring for, or that you may ever aspire for is in His holy feet. And let this world be dissolved to zero. It can’t have any effect on you. Rather, if the whole thing disappears, if it is burnt to ashes, you may be saved from that misconception.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" The Greatest Mercy"},{"class":"b43","text":" But it is not so easy to burn the world of your present enjoying conception to ashes.
