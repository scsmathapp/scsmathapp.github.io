Descending through the divine succession of the great Divine Masters down to this plane of the mundane world, the holy talks of the Lord that emanate from the lotus mouth of the pure saint are a manifestation of the Lord Himself. No one can estimate the oceanic grace of the Lord upon the fallen conditioned souls when He personally descends in this form of holy talks of Him."},{"class":"b44","text":" My most worshipful and beloved Divine Master, Om Viṣṇupād Paramahaṁsa Aṣṭottara-śata-śrī Śrīmad Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj, always loved to deliver such holy talks, especially in the supreme line of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. Whoever was fortunate to hear those talks, whether hailing from East or West, their hearts would bloom with happiness and transcendental prospect. When Śrīla Guru Mahārāj in his advanced age was barely able to muster up the physical strength to come and take his seat and speak to the devotees, I would still request him to try to speak for at least only five or ten minutes, and often, after he began, he would continue for one or even two hours or more, showing all the youthful exuberance of a young man or boy. How the great souls love to eternally sing the infinite glories of the Lord!"},{"class":"b44","text":" Today it is our great fortune that those holy words that came down to us in such a simple and charming way are being brought out in book form, for the benefit of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s world-wide mission and new sincere spiritual seekers as well. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s words are an eternal divine ecstatic flow. They are food for the hearts of the true devotees of the Supreme Lord and His associates; they are the real life of the sincere souls hankering for the godly life of divine dedication. So we are very satisfied and pleased with the efforts of Tridaṇḍi Swāmī Śrīpād Bhakti Ānanda Sāgar Mahārāj and the sincere devotees, especially—Śrī Jaya Kṛṣṇa Prabhu, Śrī Dayānidhi Prabhu, Śrī Nabadwīp Chandra Prabhu, Śrī Jagamohan Prabhu, Śrī Ṛṣabhadev Prabhu, Śrī Śrī Govinda Prabhu, Śrī Jagadānanda Prabhu, and many other good souls who have assisted him by providing the necessary funds required for bringing out this second volume in the series of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī-Bhakti-rakṣaka-divya-vāṇī—Sermons of the Guardian of Devotion</span>. Also, Śrī Devāśiṣ Prabhu, Śrīmatī Gurbanugā and Śrīmatī Bhakti Sīmā Devī Dāsīs assisted with the proofreading. May Śrīla Guru Mahārāj shower his blessings upon them all.

If one goes on with the artificial means of prāṇāyām and so on, lust and anger may seem to be a little reduced in power for the time being, but this is not a permanent cure. When the practices are slackened, they arise again. The relief from lust, anger, and greed is only temporary."},{"class":"b51","text":" The meditators and renouncers (yogīs, jñānīs) think these practices will quench their inner thirst, and they go on with constant deep meditation (nidhidhyāsanam) while keeping guard outwardly with some external practices.

They only want to invite Vāsudev in all phases of their lives, and in this way they permanently do away with those enemies."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Devotee:</span> Mahārāj, in the beginning we’re taught to follow. But it seems there is a point where we imitate and then follow later. Because we have no qualification, when we try to follow, we are actually imitating somehow.

When does imitation or anukaraṇa become following or anusaraṇa?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Guru Mahārāj:</span> In anusaraṇa, following, there is sincerity; and anukaraṇa, imitation, is only for name and fame, or pratiṣṭhā. To only imitate devotion outwardly without inner purity is more or less done to get the glory of a sādhu. And anusaraṇa means to attain from the heart, sincerely. So true following is sincere progress, and imitation is artificiality."},{"class":"b44","text":" It has been practically experienced that responsible services can help us from falling prey to lust, anger, etc. Foremost is faith (śraddhā), next is the association of pure devotees (sādhu-saṅga) and deep engagement with the duties prescribed by the Divine Master (bhajana-kriyā). Deep engagement is necessary, especially for the mind, not merely the body. And mental engagement can be attained only by responsibility. Some responsible service is given to the disciple. He feels weight and it occupies his brain; he cannot but think about it—the mind is engaged there, surely. So the mind gets no chance to dwell on lower things. This is the beauty of deep engagement in responsible service. In the practical sense, that helps us a great deal. Then association and scriptures will really be of substantial help to us: as service (paripraśna, sevā). As much as we are able to engage ourselves in deep, responsible services, the enemies’ effect on us will be minimised. They will come and peep and will step back saying, “No—no time. He is deeply engaged. He has no time to give attention to us. He may not be enticed.” In this way, they will have to retreat. Then if they return once, twice, thrice or more—“Oh, no time. He has no attention to spare for us. He is very deeply engaged—for sevā.”"},{"class":"b52","text":" Sevā, service, should not be merely physical; there is mental sevā, and only responsibility can capture the mind. In responsibility, the mind is compelled to think on the matter; otherwise, the mind may be free to wander hither and thither even while the body is apparently engaged. So engage the mind in deep service, responsible service."}]},{"title":"The Eye to See the Dhām","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b58","text":" Chapter Two"},{"class":"b47","text":" The Eye to See the Dhām"},{"class":"b70","text":" The Eye of Faith"},{"class":"b43","text":" In an ordinary country there is a capital. The capital is where the existence and position of the king is more intense than in the general section of the country. Similarly, the Lord is everywhere, and His concentrated existence is found in the Dhām or the Holy Abode. With fully developed vision, we can feel the special characteristic of the Dhām. We shall find His presence everywhere, but with particular intensity in the Dhām. With the awakening of our real eye, we should be able to feel and appreciate according to this criterion. There is no question of a Dhām for those who have no eye to see. There is also a hierarchy in the Dhām. All are in serving attitude whether birds, beasts, worms, insects—everything—all are contributing to the Reality. Their feeling of heart, their gesture, posture or movement—everything contributes exclusively to the Pastimes of the Lord."},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Dhāmera svarūpa sphuribe nayane</span>: in one song, Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur aspires for that pure vision of the Dhām. Otherwise, it may appear quite ordinary to us, like a jungle. The purity of Ganges water is only perceived by those who have proper faith or śraddhā. Otherwise, to others eyes it is ordinary water. The same applies to the Deity, or Śrī Mūrti. One may think that the Śrī Mūrti of Lord Jagannāth in Purī appears to be a somewhat awkward figure. His arms seem incomplete, His feet are not visible, His eyes are enormous. Yet Mahāprabhu stood before Him for hours, shedding tears. No one could move Him from that place. What did Mahāprabhu see in that figure, and what is He to our eyes? So according to the depth of vision of our inner eye, we can come to that plane of the Dhām, the Deity, and the purifying Ganges water. <span class=\\"e3\\">Śraddhāmayo ’yaṁ puruṣo</span> (<span class=\\"e3\\">Bg</span>: 17.3). “The nature of a person is modeled on faith.” Of what value is a mirror without an eye? In a looking-glass we should find the reflection, but if the eye is absent, what will the subject see in the glass? So the eye to see—faith—is necessary. According to the śraddhā, the specific character of the Dhām as distinct from all other places will come into view, disclosing its real form. Everything depends on śraddhā, faith."},{"class":"b44","text":" Faith is the only effective link. If we wish to have any link with the sun or the moon, ordinary instruments won’t do, but some plenary medium like electricity, etc., can help to connect us. We must approach via a plane similar to the object. Similarly, we can approach the infinite only with the help of śraddhā. We cannot hope to have any connection with that finest plane of fundamental existence of this world with the help of the eye, nose or ear, or even by intelligence or reason. If we want to have any connection with the finest plane that is underlying this creation, it is possible only through faith (<span class=\\"e3\\">śraddhāmayo ’yaṁ puruṣo</span>)."},{"class":"b69","text":" Then, the question of credibility arises: faith may be blind. But as long as the qualification of ‘blind’ faith exists, ‘seeing’ faith must also be possible! Blind faith is diseased faith, but we must connect by real or healthy faith. Then again, our experience must be confined to our own limitations; so how much faith can we accumulate?"},{"class":"b70","text":" Infinite Faith in the Infinite"},{"class":"b43","text":" When we try to establish a connection with the infinite, there are infinite possibilities. But how much faith can finite things like us have? How much can we imagine? Imagination must also have a limit, yet the infinite exists, beyond even the limit of any imagination. The infinite is so spacious and broad that even our imagination fails. How much can we imagine? We are born and bred in a cell; our experience is limited and our imagination is also limited. So imagination cannot be extended to take on an infinite character. We must be conscious that we are going to establish our relationship with the infinite, where the greatest imagination is only a point. Imagination cannot devour the infinite, so imagination must not be allowed to obstruct us. How much can we imagine? Something very meager in comparison with the infinite. We must not allow ourselves to be slaves to our imagination. The infinite is so broad. We cannot have any conception of it; we cannot imagine it. It is beyond. So we must not cower under blind faith; there may exist infinitely more than we can imagine. Only genuine faith can help us in that direction, toward the infinite. And even when we have some conception, it is said that the key to make Himself known to us is in His hand. When He opens the door, we can enter. The key is not within our hand. We can see only as much as He likes us to. He is adhokṣaja—transcendental. We first have to accept this before we can approach Him or even expect to know Him. We must prepare ourselves with this attitude of accepting Him as adhokṣaja."},{"class":"b71","text":" If He does not allow us to enter into His Domain, should we deny His existence? He is free to do as He pleases; what can He lose? It is we who are the losers. So we should submissively acknowledge the adhokṣaja realm above us. Superseding Śaṅkar Āchārya’s philosophy, Śrī Rāmānuja introduced this adhokṣaja principle."},{"class":"b70","text":" The Supersubjective Realm"},{"class":"b43","text":" Because we cannot enter that realm as a subject or making it an object of our investigation, we deny the existence of such a thing. What does this mean? Fools may be satisfied with such an imaginary tendency, but really there is such a domain, and when He wants to take us within His jurisdiction, we can have some experience of it. This is adhokṣaja. <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> warns us with this expression: adhokṣaja. He is adhokṣaja—transcendental, supramental. We cannot enter that domain as a subject. Even if we approach Him as investigators, we can know Him only as much as He allows us to. Still, we have to admit that there is such a realm, the Supersubjective Realm. We are subject, and that is Supersubject. The jīva, chaitanya, the soul, is not the final existence. Socrates said that the soul is immortal and can live independent of matter. He realised that the soul is a unit independent of matter; it is not a product of matter. Yet, the soul is not the final substance. Compared to matter, the soul is spiritual, but at the same time he may be considered like matter in comparison to his Knower, the Supersoul, Paramātma, and so on. The subjective realm progresses onward, more and more. There, all are our masters. We cannot be master there; we can only be servants. If we want to enter into the highest position, we shall accept the position of the slave of the slave. Only then can we get the chance of entering into that domain. It is not unreasonable."},{"class":"b69","text":" Some may think that matter, gas, sky, and finally ether is the limit of existence; or, beyond ether, electricity is the limit. But beyond that is the soul, as Socrates said. There, soul is existence, transcending matter in all its phases. So, also, that soul is only a particle on the gross side of the Absolute. There is finer existence as Supersoul, and onwards. Just as in the material creation there are so many stages such as earth or stone, wood, gold, etc., there is similarly a gradation in spiritual substance. Generally, two—in the lower part Vaikuṇṭha, and the highest sphere is Goloka or the land of love."},{"class":"b70","text":" The Play of the Sweet Absolute"},{"class":"b43","text":" The spiritual existence may also be divided into three basic classes: sat-chit-ānanda. Above the subjective existence of chetana or chit, the jīva-soul, there is a higher fundamental, categorically different element of ānandam, or happiness, ecstasy. That is not only chit, not only subjective, but fulfilment of the subject as ānandam, full in itself, or more specifically in Himself. And this is the main element to be found in Goloka. Knowledge is rather subservient there. Knowledge—jñān, anubhūti—perception, experience, even of the transcendental, is subservient, subdued, and the automatic flow of ānandam, beauty, and harmony is the real characteristic of the Goloka section. Jñān does not play any part there (jñāna-śūnyā-bhakti). It is something like intuition."},{"class":"b69","text":" The movement there is intuitive and full of ecstasy. There is no movement by calculation; it is all by intuition (sambandha-jñān). How and wherefrom the direction comes, they do not care to know. They are but instruments in the hands of that ānandamaya-vilās or ecstatic play. This is Goloka, and we are told that if we have faith, we shall take the trouble of making a journey toward that plane. Faith should be the guide, impelled by our intense desire (lobha, laulyam). Our attraction and feeling of necessity for it takes precedence: “Yes, I want that.” Then, we begin. Just as Hegel said, “The idea precedes the action.” So, in śraddhā, we feel, “Yes, I want that thing.” Then we shall take the trouble of approaching it. So we are told that the highest position is such, that is, intuitive labour of love in the Divine Pastimes (vilās). And that is the conception of the highest quarter, where one can find the best happiness, or ecstasy. One who has attraction for that will take the trouble of accepting it and going to that place; that is given by <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> and Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b70","text":" The Land of Beauty"},{"class":"b43","text":" Satyam is the land of the conception of existence, śivam is the land of good, and sundaram is the land of beauty. Śivam means maṅgalam, that is, that which is safe from mortality—unassailable existence. There is existence in mortality; the material energy also exists. But there is a land where there is no death, and that is considered to be śivam or maṅgalam. And sundaram is the positive life of attraction. One aspires to live such a life. Sundaram is a life worth living. There is such a land in the highest quarter. Mahāprabhu and <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> called us for that: “Here is a soil, and you are a child of that soil. If you analyse yourself deeply, you will find that you are a child of that soil. You are not created for this land where you are always suffering from uncertainty and apprehension. Apprehension and uncertainty are always troubling you; you must cross beyond them, go up, and you will find śivam—no apprehension, but the positive life. If you really like to have it, you will have to enter into the area of Goloka, the land of beauty and love. No consideration of calculation, no necessity of calculation or anything else. There, no fraud or deception can ever be dreamed of, so calculation and reasoning have no place at all. Automatically, all is good, all is fulfilment. It is the general conception.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" Then, for satisfaction’s sake, Yogamāyā has designed things in such a way that Kṛṣṇa’s associates are afraid of losing Him, and Kṛṣṇa also misses Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, or Mother Yaśodā, etc. This is designed to maintain the Pastimes there, and not out of necessity.

What is the perfection of humility for the kaniṣṭha-adhikārī?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Guru Mahārāj:</span> It may vary for different persons. So one has to think out his own way. Humility means ‘to not encroach on the rights of others’. And also, it should not be such as to kill one’s own self. It must be natural. At the time of entering the present Bagh Bazaar Math (of Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭh in Kolkata), there was a festival. From a rented house, the Deities were brought on a chariot in procession. There was chanting and dancing, and the Deities were installed in the new Temple. Mahāprasādam was distributed. At twelve or one o’clock that night we went to bed. My bed was just nearby the bed of one of my Godbrothers, a learned professor. He was very humble. In the morning, the professor said to me, speaking very slowly, “Last night, I felt so much weakness that I thought I was dying. I thought that I would arouse you, but then again I thought, ‘No, why should I disturb the Vaiṣṇava? He’s so tired tonight, and having his rest, so let me wait’; and after waiting a little I gained some strength, so I did not have to disturb you. But I’m still very weak now.” Very slowly, and soberly, he told these things. He was dying and he did not arouse me, only for fear of disturbing my rest."},{"class":"b51","text":" When I heard these things from his lips that morning, although of course he put it very gently, it struck me like thunder! I at once went to Prabhupād and informed him that such was the case: “A gentleman was almost dying last night, but he was too meek to disturb me.” Prabhupād and the devotees also knew of our professor Godbrother’s nature. They took the matter seriously and immediately called for a doctor. Sometimes I think such humility to be dangerous. The disciple’s life is a valuable property of his Guru Mahārāj’s, not merely his own. He’s not to be concerned with only his interest, but he should live in the interest of his Gurudev. I could not appreciate such humility. Everything must be of a real characteristic—connected with reality. I am thirsty; perhaps I won’t request any Vaiṣṇava, “Please help me with a glass of water.” Then my disease may continue, for the sake of penny wise, pound foolishness. Common sense should be utilised always."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Devotee:</span> Just before Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj left the world, he was in Vṛndāvan. He was lying on the bed, unable to eat anything; his condition was so bad he could barely take even a glass of water.

We are not against anything of that type. But we must consider what will be most effective according to our capacity. At the same time we must not commit any offense by omission. If we say that smaraṇ is superior and that the other types of bhajan like pāda-sevana, etc., are of a lower order, how can we be so audacious as to condemn them in such a way? Still, we may distinguish very cautiously, but not merely to satisfy our curiosity. Only when the necessity arises shall we venture to establish the superiority of Lakṣmī over Śukadev, or Ambarīṣ, and so on. But we must not venture to make light of such matters. These are all serious points. To consider one Vaiṣṇava over another is not a game; the points are very subtle. They are devotees, and we must not venture to place one above the other according to our crude necessity. It is not an academic exercise that as a professor we shall amass some theoretical knowledge to quote to the students. It should not be accepted in that line.

He’s always situated within infinite possibility. But he’s humble to his master, not to the guṇḍās (rogues). His humility must be chiefly towards whom? “I am humble, the lowest of the low, to whom? Towards my master. I am humble towards the Lord’s own, the Vaiṣṇava. I am humble there.” When it is necessary for Hanumānjī to burn the golden city of Laṅkā, his humility is not disturbed. He is as humble as anyone can be in carrying out the order of Lord Rāmachandra. He is fully given, wholly surrendered."},{"class":"b51","text":" Humility, in other words, is surrendering. Humility means no opposition to the command of the master who is related to Vaikuṇṭha, the upper section, not to the ordinary street zone or tiger or serpent. Humility does not drag them into the relativity of the serpent, tiger, or jackal. Their real relationship is with the Vaiṣṇava. That is the plane where the devotee takes his stand. He’s concerned with the Vaiṣṇava. And ‘humble’ means that he does not resist his master’s instruction. Without opposition, he carries out whatever order comes to him. He is humble. He possesses humility, sunīchatā. He is not sitting on a seat of prejudice. Generally, we think of humility as pertaining to the outside world, but this is not the meaning. To the standard-thinking person, the members of the outside world are deluded; they are mad. Humility is not in the standard of madness or catering to the mad people. A madman has no standard of his own. So humility means to have a standard from the standard world.

Enjoying spirit, or exploitation, means aggression. There, there cannot be humility. Humility is only cent-per-cent service. There is no humility in exploitation, or renunciation either. These two are opposed to the normal nature of the world. They are totally misconceived. They are enemies. They are the challenging element to the normal reality.

Those hairs are said to have taken the forms of Kṛṣṇa and Balarām. They took up those two robes, but in that instance They are only Bhū-bhāra-haraṇakārī Avatārs, or descents appearing to relieve the Earth of its burden, and not Svayam Bhagavān or the Supreme Lord in Person.

The lower personality is absorbed. Just as when the prime minister comes to the city, the state governor’s function is absorbed in him, if he wishes. When the king comes to visit the colony, all the officers’ powers really vanish in him. Whatever he does must automatically be done by them, their own respective personalities dead.

In Kolkata there is a place called Hāṭ-khola Dutta which was named after the family. Near Bīrnagar there was a big village named Ulā, and the family of the title Mustauphi were landowners there. Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur’s mother came from this line. Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur was born and brought up at Ulā, and he studied at Kṛṣṇanagar College. Of course, he had exceptional talent. He came into contact with the then educated society. Especially, there was a Mr. Duff, a Christian missionary who established the Scottish Church College. Duff was encouraging and attracting many of the young Bengalis of the time to take up Christianity. Gradually, Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur had close association with the Brahmo Society, the so-called culturally advanced followers of Rām Mohan Rāy. Maharṣi Devendranāth Ṭhākur’s elder brother, Dvijendranāth, was his very intimate friend."},{"class":"b44","text":" For his livelihood he accepted government service.

When he was serving in Dinājpur he gave his speech on <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span>, and it was then that he completely separated himself from the Brahmo school, and he was seen to side with the Vaiṣṇava school of thought in the line of Mahāprabhu.

With the help of those records, and by his divine inspiration, he discovered the birthplace at Yoga Pīṭh, Māyāpur. Then, with deepened interest, he visited the entire Nabadwīp Maṇḍal, and with reference to the scriptures, he gave a description of both the ancient and contemporary holy places in the Dhām of Mahāprabhu.

Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur finally entrusted him with the direct service of Māyāpur. He accepted that, a little hesitantly at first, but to his last moment he conducted the service faithfully. In that matter, from the practical standpoint Kuñja Bihārī Vidyā Bhūṣaṇ, later Śrīmad Tīrtha Mahārāj, assisted Prabhupād a great deal. Gradually, many scholars also gathered around him.

Shishir Ghosh also once said, “We have heard of the six Goswāmīs of the time of Mahāprabhu, but Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur’s writings prove that he holds the seventh position amongst the Goswāmīs.

Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur selected Śrīla Gaura Kiśor for him, but from what we have found in him, he knew Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur as his Guru from the internal consideration. We find his outside and inside was filled with Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur. Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur not in the physical sense, but in the spiritual sense.

When Anderson, the Governor, was invited to Māyāpur, at that time it was arranged with a Kolkata hotel to bring appropriate food for the function, including even meats.

And when Prabhupād suggested some similar approach in foreign preaching also, I modestly protested that if the meat dishes, non-vegetarian dishes, were served in the Maṭh area, it would bring criticism to the mission; to which he replied, “No, no! I decided all these things thousands of births ago. We have to do anything and everything for the service of Mahāprabhu.” That was his answer.

The grace of Mahāprabhu should be distributed throughout the length and breadth of the whole world. And for that, anything should be done. No stone unturned. Physical connection is no connection. We shall try to save our internal purity; that is all.” And to save so many souls from impure habits and diet, Śrīmad Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj also took the risk of external contamination by filthy things.

Mukunda Datta was a very good singer, and in a very sweet tone he sang this śloka of <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span>:"},{"class":"b60","text":" aho bakī yaṁ stana-kāla-kūṭaṁ<br />jighāṁsayāpāyayad apy asādhvī<br />lebhe gatiṁ dhātry uchitāṁ tato ’nyaṁ<br />kaṁ vā dayāluṁ śaraṇaṁ vrajema"},{"class":"b43","text":" This śloka was chanted by Mukunda in a very sweet tone, and this created a wonderful effect in Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi. The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> says, “Who else but Kṛṣṇa should we approach? Who can be so kind, so gracious? There is limitless grace in Him. Why? Bakī-Pūtanā came to kill Him in a treacherous way, taking the garb of dhātrī, a motherly garb. In this way she came to try and kill Him, yet Kṛṣṇa gave her a position as a nursemaid in His group of assisting mothers. So gracious is the Lord. Who else can we approach for our good?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" This is the meaning of the verse. “She painted deadly poison on her breast and came to suckle the boy Kṛṣṇa. So treacherous was her action. In the garb of motherly affection she tried to murder the boy, and she was given such a high position as an attendant of His mother. She was elevated to the motherly group. Such grace, such mercy He showed, without considering or passing judgment on the worth of that action. So other than that kind-hearted and gracious Kṛṣṇa, where else should we go for shelter?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" This entered the heart of Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi and began to vibrate and produced such force that he was stunned; then shivering began, and madly gesticulating, he began to pull his hair and tear his silken dress, kicking over the tobacco and pipe. His rich bedding and dress were ruined, and he began to roll on the ground and cry, <span class=\\"e3\\">kaṁ vā dayāluṁ śaraṇaṁ vrajema</span>: “In whom shall we take shelter other than Him?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then Gadādhar Paṇḍit thought, “Oh, I have committed a great offense in my mind, thinking that he was not a Vaiṣṇava because of his fashionable dress and style. Really, how great a Vaiṣṇava he is—what a wonderful effect the memory of Kṛṣṇa caused in him!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then Gadādhar Paṇḍit revealed his mind. “Mukunda, I have committed offense against this great Vaiṣṇava. What will be my fate? When I first saw him, I shunned him; I committed offense. I think that if I take mantra from him—become his disciple—then he may forgive all my offenses. There is no other way to be absolved from this Vaiṣṇava-aparādh. I shall have to inform my Lord Gaurachandra, Nimāi Paṇḍit, about this.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" So they left the place of Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi, and Gadādhar went to take Nimāi Paṇḍit’s permission to become the disciple of Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi."},{"class":"b44","text":" Before anyone knew that Puṇḍarīk had come from Chaṭṭa Grām to Nabadwīp, and even before Mahāprabhu had met him, Mahāprabhu was seen to suddenly cry, “Bāp Puṇḍarīk! Bāp Puṇḍarīk!” In the mood of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, Nimāi was taking his name. <span class=\\"e3\\">Bāp</span> means ‘father’. So He was calling, “Father, Puṇḍarīk! Father, Puṇḍarīk!” Nimāi Paṇḍit was chanting like this, in the mood of Rādhārāṇī."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Gadādhar made his proposal to Mahāprabhu, the Lord immediately replied, “Yes, very good proposal. Go and accept him at once.” Gadādhar Paṇḍit represents Rādhārāṇī in Gaura-līlā, and Puṇḍarīk is Rādhārāṇī’s father in Kṛṣṇa-līlā: the Guru is like the father, and the disciple is like the child. So Mahāprabhu at once approved, and Gadādhar took initiation from Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi. He was none other than Vṛṣabhānurāj, and Gadādhar was the incarnation of Rādhārāṇī in Gaura-līlā."},{"class":"b44","text":" Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi would not take bath in the Ganges because he could not tolerate that his feet would touch the holy Ganges River. Before daybreak, he would go to the Ganges and take some of the water on his head. He did not go to the Ganges by day, because he could not tolerate to see persons who would dive into the water or spit there and contaminate the pure, holy water by misusing it. Before worship, prayer, etc., the general paṇḍit section may bathe in the Ganges and fast to purify their bodies of sin. But Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi would rather drink some Ganges water prior to his daily worship and duties, thereby teaching us the proper worshipful respect due to the Gaṅgā."},{"class":"b44","text":" In Purī, his dearmost friend and associate was Śrī Svarūp Dāmodar. When he went to Purī, he felt some pain in his heart that the priestly servants of Lord Jagannāth dressed the Lord in starched cloth, which is generally considered impure. When cloth is manufactured by hand loom, the thread is soaked in boiled rice water which acts as a paste to hold it firm in the loom. That cloth is considered impure, and must first be rinsed in water before offering it to the Deity. But in Purī, that was not the practice. They directly used starched cloth for dressing Lord Jagannāth, and Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi could not accommodate this."},{"class":"b44","text":" That night, he dreamt that both Jagannāth and Balarām came to him and dealt slaps to his cheeks, saying, “You have come here to point out the defects in My servitors? What is this!” They both began to slap him, and the dream was so intense that when he rose in the morning he found that both his cheeks were inflamed. He expressed to his most intimate friend, Svarūp Dāmodar: “My dear friend, Svarūp Dāmodar, such is my position. I had this objectionable feeling in my heart towards these servitors, so Jagannāth and Balarām have punished me in this way. See the swelling on both cheeks!”"},{"class":"b69","text":" Such was the nature of Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi. In essence, we are told that he is the father of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, incarnated here as Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi. A slight holy association of this day, his appearance day, will help us a great deal in our advancement of spiritual life."},{"class":"b70","text":" 3. The Appearance of Śrī Raghunandan Ṭhākur"},{"class":"b43","text":" Thirdly, this is also the birthday of Raghunandan Ṭhākur. He was born in a place named Śrīkhaṇḍa, near Katwa, in a Kavirāj family, a lineage of Ayurvedic doctors. Raghunandan was the son of Mukunda Kavirāj, who was such a notable doctor that even kings called for him for treatment. Raghunandan was a bachelor his whole life. His figure was extraordinarily beautiful, and he was very fond of dancing. From the beginning he was, of course, a natural devotee."},{"class":"b44","text":" The family of Mukunda Ṭhākur worshipped their ancestral Deity at home. Once, when Raghunandan was a growing boy, who had perhaps only recently received the sacred thread and admission to worship, his father asked him, “I’m going out and won’t return in time. You please worship the Deity and feed Him—offer bhoga for His food.” His expression was, “Please try to feed my Deity.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" When he was away, Raghunandan’s mother cooked many items and brought them to the temple and asked Raghunandan to offer them to the Deity. Generally, the doors are kept closed during worship, so behind the closed doors Raghunandan offered and prayed to the Lord,"},{"class":"b44","text":" “Please take these dishes I am offering You—please eat.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" But the Śrī-Mūrti did not answer or come forward to eat. Raghunandan began to cry."},{"class":"b44","text":" “My father will rebuke me! He has requested me to feed You, and You are not eating. I’ll be punished. You have to take this food!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The sincere boy began to cry in such a way that Kṛṣṇa had to eat."},{"class":"b44","text":" Raghunandan was satisfied and came out from the Deity room."},{"class":"b44","text":" His mother came to remove the prasādam."},{"class":"b44","text":" “What is this? All the plates are empty!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Raghunandan replied, “You asked me to feed the Deity. He has taken.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" His mother said angrily, “You, boy, you have eaten it! The Deity doesn’t eat. We offer, everything remains, and afterwards we take the prasādam. You wicked boy, you have turned out to be such a rogue—you have eaten everything.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “No, no, I did not eat, the Deity ate everything.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “This is impossible, you foolish boy! Do you want to make a fool of me? This can never happen!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He began to cry."},{"class":"b44","text":" “No, I’m speaking the truth.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “All right, let your father come, and I shall ask him to punish you.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Mukunda returned, and Raghunandan’s mother complained,"},{"class":"b44","text":" “Your boy has grown to be such a rogue! He says the Deity has eaten.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Raghunandan also petitioned his father, “Yes, the Deity has eaten. He would not take in the beginning, but I began to cry, and then He ate.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “Is this true?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “Yes, it is true my father; I am not lying.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “Can you show me?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “I shall try.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" So he was given another chance to worship, and from a hidden place his father could see that the Deity had actually taken the food."},{"class":"b44","text":" Such a devotee was Raghunandan Ṭhākur. When he danced in saṅkīrtan, it was such a charming scene that even Mahāprabhu was attracted. During the Jagannāth Ratha Yātrā, seven special groups would chant and dance, and in the party from Śrīkhaṇḍa, we find that Raghunandan was the dancer."},{"class":"b69","text":" So today is the day connected with the memory of Śrī Raghunandan Ṭhākur, who is considered to be Pradyumna Avatār. Many more incidents occur in his pastimes. I have only touched on them. It is also said that near the banks of the lake Madhu-puṣkariṇī there is a jambu tree, and according to his wish two kadamba flowers bloom on that tree every day for the worship of his Deity. Many miracles are found in his pastimes."},{"class":"b70","text":" 4. The Appearance of Śrī Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī"},{"class":"b43","text":" Then, the fourth personality is Śrī Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī. He was born nearly five hundred years ago in Kṛṣṇapur village, Hooghly District. He came in the kāyastha caste. His father, Hiraṇya Majumdār, was a very rich man. His father had one brother, Govardhan, but Raghunāth was the only child. His father and uncle were state landowners. At that time, they collected 20 lakhs (2,000,000) rupees in taxes. 12 lakhs was to be paid to the king, and their net income was 8 lakhs."},{"class":"b44","text":" Raghunāth heard about Mahāprabhu after His sannyās. Hiraṇya and Govardhan had association with Advaita Āchārya, and they used to make an annual contribution to all the superior Sanskrit scholars and their schools, in Bengal, of the time."},{"class":"b51","text":" When Mahāprabhu went back to Śrī Advaita Āchārya’s house (Advaita-bhavan) after His sannyās, Raghunāth Dās came and saw Him and became mad with love of Kṛṣṇa. His heart was completely melted by Mahāprabhu’s beauty and charming personality, His devotion, and His teachings of devotion for Kṛṣṇa. Mahāprabhu Himself was also aware of this. Raghunāth would not leave Mahāprabhu, but the Lord told him, “Go home. Don’t be over-enthusiastic; control yourself. Keep your divine love for Kṛṣṇa within your heart, and don’t express it outwardly. Don’t advertise it. Very soon the time will come when Kṛṣṇa will guide you. He will make a way for you. Don’t allow any external show but keep it within your heart.”"},{"class":"b59","text":" sthira hañā ghare yāo, nā hao vātula<br />krame krame pāya loka bhava-sindhu-kūla"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Chaitanya-charitāmṛta: Madhya, 16.237)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “Compose yourself and go home—don’t be a madman. One reaches the shore of the material ocean gradually.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, he later came into the association of Nityānanda Prabhu in Pāṇihāṭi. Nityānanda Prabhu said to him, “Give a feast here for My followers. You are the son of a rich man, so manage to give a feast here for My followers.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Raghunāth did so, and Nityānanda Prabhu was very satisfied. He also blessed him, saying, “Very soon your bright day will come.” And He addressed His devotees, “See this young boy—he has immense wealth; in abundance he has everything required for a young man’s enjoyment, but he does not care for it. Kṛṣṇa’s grace has come down into his heart, so he does not care for anything of this world, but he’s mad to leave his home of material grandeur and become a street beggar. He has become mad for Kṛṣṇa. Just see this high ideal—devotion, attraction. Love of Kṛṣṇa has made him mad. He is very, very fortunate. This royal dignity and prosperity cannot please him.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Anyway, he returned home. But one day Hiraṇya and the others noticed that he no longer entered the inner section of the house. He began to stay in the outer section only. His father and other guardians thought that his condition had become very grave, so ten men were engaged to keep guard that he may not leave."},{"class":"b44","text":" One day in the early morning before sunrise, the family Guru, Yadunandan Āchārya, suddenly entered the house. Finding Raghunāth in the outer section of the house, he met him and requested him, “I am going out for some important business, but there is no one to worship my Deity. So please ask one brāhmaṇ disciple in my name to serve the Deity for a day or two during my absence.” As Yadunandan Āchārya left, Raghunāth went with him. The guards saw him going with the family Guru, so they did not interfere. On the way, Raghunāth requested the Guru, “You may go ahead with your business, and I shall request the gentleman to do the worship in your absence.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The Guru left. Raghunāth took advantage of the situation. Perhaps he requested that man to do the service, but he started off in the direction away from Purī. He knew that as soon as they realised at home that he wasn’t returning, they would send men to search for him on the way to Purī. So for the whole day he walked in the opposite direction. In the evening he stopped at a cow herdsman’s house, took a little milk from him and passed the night in the cowshed. Then in the morning he started for Purī."},{"class":"b44","text":" When his guardians found that Raghunāth had not returned home, they heard from the guards that he had gone with the family Guru. They went to the Guru’s house, but Raghunāth was not to be found. Then they thought that he must have left for Purī, and they sent ten men to that side. They returned without finding him. In this way, Raghunāth cleverly managed to escape. For twelve days he walked to Purī, taking food here and there for only three of those days. On the other days no food was necessary. He was helped by divine love, surcharged."},{"class":"b44","text":" He had already heard that Mahāprabhu was at the Gambhīrā, the Kāśī Miśra Bhavan. He went there, and in the courtyard fell flat in obeisance unto Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mukunda Datta announced to the Lord, “Raghunāth has come.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu said, “Yes, look after him. He has come with great difficulty, walking and walking without food. Take care of him for a few days. Then, he will manage for himself.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" That was the direction of Mahāprabhu. For a few days Raghunāth took prasādam there. After that he began to beg at the gate of the Jagannāth Temple."},{"class":"b44","text":" The parents now thought it was impossible to bring him back, and they did not make any further attempt. But they sent some money with one brāhmaṇ and two servants, instructing them to hire a house and offer Raghunāth a place to stay and see that their son may not die without food. They tried their best, but Raghunāth continued to subsist on alms. Over a period of two years, Raghunāth invited Mahāprabhu to take prasādam at that house, and the Lord did so for his satisfaction. After that, Raghunāth left that idea, thinking, “This is only to produce some name and fame for me. Mahāprabhu is not pleased with such prasādam.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Svarūp Dāmodar was the dearmost attendant of Mahāprabhu and a very good scholar as well. Raghunāth was also a scholar—we find that later he left the world beautiful poetry in Sanskrit. Mahāprabhu gave Raghunāth over to the charge of Svarūp Dāmodar, saying, “I request Svarūp Dāmodar to take your charge, and he will advise you what will be necessary for your devotional life.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" But suddenly one day, Raghunāth approached Mahāprabhu: “Why have You managed to take me out of my house, and what is my best benefit? If You please tell me in Your own words, my heart will be satisfied.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" Mahāprabhu said, “I have given you over to the charge of Svarūp Dāmodar. He is more qualified than even Myself. Still, if you want to hear something directly from Me, then I say in brief:"},{"class":"b60","text":" grāmya-kathā nā śunibe, grāmya-vārtā nā kahibe<br />bhāla nā khāibe āra bhāla nā paribe<br />amānī mānada hañā kṛṣṇa-nāma sadā la’be<br />vraje rādhā-kṛṣṇa sevā mānase karibe"},{"class":"b43","text":" “Don’t indulge in worldly talk, don’t hear worldly talk. Try your best to avoid mundane matters. Don’t eat delicious dishes, but take whatever ordinary food may come of its own accord, and don’t dress luxuriously. Always try to take the Name of Kṛṣṇa with the attitude of giving respect to others, without expecting respect from anyone. Be humble, but never aspire after respectful dealings from others. In this way, try to take the Name of Kṛṣṇa constantly. And within, try to serve Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvan. Mentally, be in Vṛndāvan rendering service to Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa-līlā.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu told Raghunāth that this was the essence of His advice to him. Then, He again took Raghunāth’s hand and offered it to the hand of Svarūp Dāmodar. He said, “I am giving you to the charge of Svarūp Dāmodar. He is the best spiritual teacher. He will take care of you.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" After Raghunāth’s arrival in Purī, Mahāprabhu stayed there continuously for sixteen years. After that, Mahāprabhu departed from the world. Raghunāth left Purī and went to Vṛndāvan, thinking, “I have what is to be had; now I only want to see Vṛndāvan Dhām once, and then I shall leave this body by jumping from the highest peak of Govardhan.” With this idea he went to Vṛndāvan, but there he came into contact with Sanātan Goswāmī and Rūpa Goswāmī. He found the beginning of a new life. He thought, “What is this? Mahāprabhu has not departed; He is living in them.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu delegated Rūpa and Sanātan with the power to preserve the devotional current they had received from Him and to present it in a new light. They were asked to prove by drawing upon different scriptures that Mahāprabhu’s teachings are the very gist and purpose of all the scriptures. As in <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">vedaiś cha sarvair Aham eva vedyaḥ</span>: “The attempt of every revealed scripture is to show Me as the Highest Center—I am the Absolute.” So Mahāprabhu said, “Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute. With the help of the different scriptures and historical reference, by all means possible, try to prove that Kṛṣṇa is Svayam Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that Vraja-līlā, Vṛndāvan-līlā, is the highest achievement.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The two brothers had already begun that work when Raghunāth came into their association, and he found, “Oh! Mahāprabhu is here.” He abandoned the idea of leaving this world and joined Rūpa and Sanātan as their disciple. Mahāprabhu had already ordered Sanātan Goswāmī, “My followers are very poor and helpless. You’ll have to look after them whenever they come to Vṛndāvan. You’ll have to be the caretaker of all my disciples that come to Vṛndāvan.” So Raghunāth came to Sanātan Goswāmī, and Sanātan took care of him."},{"class":"b44","text":" Raghunāth was so self-forgetful that one day as he was sitting on the banks of Rādhā Kuṇḍa and taking the Name, a tiger came just beside him to drink water, but Raghunāth paid no attention. Suddenly, Sanātan Goswāmī came upon the scene. He was astonished. Up until then Raghunāth had lived under the shade of a tree, but Sanātan said, “Please construct a hut to live in. Don’t disregard my request—I entreat you to do this.” Then from that time he managed to construct a small dwelling and stay there. His abnegation, vairāgya, was incomparable. Sanātan, Rūpa, and all the Goswamīs’ indifference to worldly enjoyment was extreme, but Raghunāth’s abnegation surpassed all."},{"class":"b44","text":" When he was in Purī, sometimes he would beg prasādam at the gate of the Jagannāth Temple, and sometimes he would take prasādam at a chatram or free kitchen where rich men distribute prasādam for beggars. But then he thought, “I am taking what is due to others’ karma.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The unsold Jagannāth prasādam is given to the cows of Jagannāth Purī. But when it becomes so stale that it emits a bad odor, even the cows cannot eat it. So now Raghunāth would wash that prasādam with sufficient water, and adding a little salt he would eat that. Mahāprabhu heard about this, and one day when Raghunāth was taking that prasādam, Mahāprabhu approached and suddenly took some and ate it. He said, “Oh! I have tasted many times the prasādam of Jagannāth, but such sweet prasādam I have never taken anywhere!”"},{"class":"b69","text":" So, what is the taste in prasādam? It is not mundane. Raghunāth had such intense faith in prasādam that he lived on apparently rotten things with a little salt—and he was the son of a family of kingly opulence. So much indifference was in him. And in his last days in Vṛndāvan, he would pass each day taking only a pot of ghol, buttermilk. This is not possible for a man of flesh and blood. Great souls like the Goswāmīs are really personalities come down from the other world, and so it was possible for them to show the ideal of abnegation. It is not possible for ordinary humans of flesh and blood to observe such a degree of abnegation without dying. But the Goswāmīs created the standard and ideal by such vairāgya. At the same time, Raghunāth studied Rūpa Goswāmī’s presentation of the highest type of rasa or devotional sentiment: madhura-rasa."},{"class":"b70","text":" The Acme of Divine Service"},{"class":"b50","text":" Śrīla Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī appreciated the acme of divine service, the culminating point of divine service, Rādhā-dāsyam, which is servitude unto Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Therefore, he is called the Prayojan-āchārya. Śrīla Sanātan Goswāmī is generally conceived of by his successors as the Āchārya of sambandha-jñān. Sambandha refers to ‘what is what’—‘what is my position in the spiritual hierarchy’. That was explained most clearly by Śrīla Sanātan Goswāmī. And abhidheya—what we should cultivate in order to attain to our objective—was mainly given by Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī. He taught us how we can attain fulfilment of our life in the domain of love. And what is particularly the highest point of our attainment, or prayojan, was very vividly shown by Śrīla Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī. In his famous śloka he says:"},{"class":"b60","text":" āśā-bharair amṛta-sindhu-mayaiḥ kathañchit<br />kālo mayāti-gamitaḥ kila sāmprataṁ hi<br />tvañ chet kṛpāṁ mayi vidhāsyasi naiva kiṁ me<br />prāṇair vrajena cha varoru bakāriṇāpi"},{"class":"b43","text":" This śloka has given us the highest conception of our attainment in the school of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu.

It is heart-melting, heart-attracting, heart-crushing. It is so deeply touching me—I can’t avoid Your service connection. Somehow, I have managed to come such a long way, to endure such a long time, but I am impatient now. Be gracious; if You are not gracious upon me, I have got no hope. I will come to the end of my patience."},{"class":"b44","text":" “My life will end here. So much so, that, what shall I do with this Vṛndāvan? Vṛndāvan is of no use to me! What is the utility of living my life? It is useless; it will end with no utility. I can’t love even Vṛndāvan, which is associated with the līlā of Kṛṣṇa. To say nothing of Vṛndāvan, I can’t relish the company of even Kṛṣṇa, without You. Without You, even Kṛṣṇa is meaningless to me. I can’t tolerate; I can’t relish either my own life, or this environment, or even Kṛṣṇa—if He Himself comes to grace me, I can’t relish that, without Your connection."},{"class":"b44","text":" “So please be gracious upon me. You are all-in-all. Without You, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Your position is so great, so beautiful in Kṛṣṇa-līlā. You are the center of all the līlā of Kṛṣṇa. Without You I can’t conceive of any life worth living. I utterly surrender unto You, my Queen.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" This is Rādhā-dāsyam. Our best fulfilment is in the service of Śrī Śrī Rādhā, because only She can fully attract the grace of Kṛṣṇa. She is the other Half who can draw the maximum rasa, ecstasy, from Kṛṣṇa, in quantity as well as in quality. So those who are serving Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī get the highest type of qualitative rasa from Kṛṣṇa in reciprocation for their service. That cannot be had through any other channel. Service that comes through Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is of the highest quality, so Her service should be our summum bonum of life."},{"class":"b69","text":" This was announced clearly by Śrīla Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī who is considered to be Prayojan-āchārya, the guide to show us our highest fulfilment of life.

The <span class=\\"e3\\">Gurvaṣṭakam</span> we chant daily was written by him, as well as many other important works. Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī wrote <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</span> (<span class=\\"e3\\">The Nectarine Ocean of Devotional Joy</span>), and Śrīla Viśvanāth wrote <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu-bindu</span> or a drop of that ocean. And from Śrīla Rūpa’s <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi</span> (<span class=\\"e3\\">The Brilliant Jewel of the Supernatural World</span>), or Kṛṣṇa in madhura-rasa, he gave <span class=\\"e3\\">Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi-kiraṇa</span> or a ray of that jewel. In this way, he has given volumes of books and poems. As Śrī Rūpa Goswāmī gave the aṣṭa-kāliyā-līlā of Kṛṣṇa, or twenty-four hour service engagement with Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Govinda, he has similarly given in Chaitanya-līlā twenty-four hour engagement in the service of Śrīman Mahāprabhu. So he has done great service to the sampradāya and profusely bestowed his mercy upon us."},{"class":"b70","text":" 6. Departure of Tridaṇḍi Swāmīs Śrīmad Bhāratī Mahārāj and Śrīmad Parvat Mahārāj"},{"class":"b43","text":" Today is also the disappearance day of two of our senior Godbrothers, sannyāsī disciples of our Guru Mahārāj, Tridaṇḍi Swāmī Śrīmad Bhakti Vivek Bhāratī Mahārāj and Tridaṇḍi Swāmī Śrīmad Bhakti Svarūp Parvat Mahārāj. They both preached extensively on the order of Śrīla Prabhupād. Śrī Bhāratī Mahārāj was very popular; his preaching style was very charming and engaging. In the beginning we appreciated his preaching very much."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrī Parvat Mahārāj was also among the earliest disciples of our Guru Mahārāj. He was born at Svarūp Gañja, on the other side of the Ganges from here (Nabadwīp). He was born in the house directly next to Surabhi Kuñj where Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur lived for some time. During his childhood, he told me, he saw Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur chanting the Name. In the early morning Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur would chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra just as one calling someone from a distance. A living thing—like one man calling another. In this way, in a living way, he was calling Kṛṣṇa. He was in his old age, and his body was somewhat attacked with rheumatism. There was a cement chair constructed there; he would stroll about at his sweet will, and when he felt fatigued, he would take his seat on that chair. That chair is still there today."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, at a very early age, Śrīmad Parvat Mahārāj came to Śrīla Prabhupād and accepted his shelter. For a long period he was posted as the caretaker at Bhakti Kuṭīr, the then ‘head office’, a small seaside house in Purī owned by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur. Then, when Prabhupād began his preaching life, Parvat Mahārāj became a sannyāsī. During the lifetime of Prabhupād, he preached throughout the whole of Bengal and beyond as well. He established a Maṭh in Orissa."},{"class":"b44","text":" I remember, once, when I was a newcomer in the Maṭh, he was telling one gentleman about how he preached on the east side of Bengal. At that place, some people challenged him, “Why have you come to preach here? Don’t you know that just nearby on the bank of the river there is a siddha-mahātmā? He has attained the highest end of life. Have you seen him?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He replied to them, “I have seen many siddha, like āloo-siddha, etc.!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Siddha may mean ‘perfected soul’, but another meaning of siddha is ‘boiled’.

You are insulting him.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He replied, “This is no insult. Those who are full of all those siddhas—they know nothing. What Mahāprabhu has brought us is the highest. All other proposals are trash and nasty things. We have come from a great Mahātmā to carry to you the highest objective, the summum bonum of life—accept Mahāprabhu and <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span>.

So both the mental and physical habits of the mlechchha and Yavana (non-Vedic races and sects) are impure, that is, closely connected with hiṁsā or animal-killing, etc., and generally their lifestyles are uncontrolled and boisterous in many other ways. They are not regulated according to the Vedic scriptures. Considering all this, those brāhmaṇs won’t allow them entry to the Temple."},{"class":"b44","text":" Even Gāndhī wanted to enter the Purī Temple with some of his outcast or lower caste followers, but they were prohibited. Gāndhī also stayed out. He wanted to enter along with the outcasts of society. Despite his great influence over the country, he was refused entrance. Without his knowledge, Gāndhī’s wife entered to have the darśan of Lord Jagannāth. When he came to know of it, he severely chastised her for entering without him."},{"class":"b44","text":" So Gāndhī was more of a patriot than a devotee. He thought his lordship over his wife was permanent and absolute, not to be modified even by devotion for Lord Jagannāth. But according to us, his wife did right.

And what is the relationship with the Lord—the Husband of husbands, the Master of the whole world? What is the nasty husband in this world in comparison with the Lord of the whole universe?

Furthermore, Sanātan Goswāmī wrote in <span class=\\"e3\\">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa</span> that the devotees should try to follow all the rules and regulations he had listed therein, and any further practices that were not mentioned should be ascertained by noting the current practices in the Temple of Jagannāth. He was so catholic in his faith in Mahāprabhu. In other words, whatever transpired there in the presence of Mahāprabhu should be taken by us as approved by Him, so we won’t dare to interfere with that. He is above law.

Indiscriminately, they use starched cloth for dressing the Jagannāth Deity.” At night he found that Jagannāth and Balarām, two Brothers, had come to his bedside and were slapping him on both cheeks. In the morning he found that his cheeks were swollen. Others asked him, “Why are your cheeks so swollen?” He had to recount the incident. In effect, the Lord was saying, “This is not the place to suggest any change in the regulation that is going on under My direction—don’t interfere!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" So there is some special grant and there are some special rules for that place.

Both negative and positive sides are to be considered. <span class=\\"e3\\">Daṇḍa</span> means ‘punishment’, as well as ‘staff’. The three daṇḍas represent thought, word, and deed. On the negative side, the three daṇḍas of the symbolic triple staff or tridaṇḍa that the Vaiṣṇava sannyāsī accepts indicate that he should not use his thought, word, and deed for any mundane or exploitative aim and object.

They have the positive side."},{"class":"b50","text":" So, to check these three aspects of life from mingling with the incidents of this mundane world is only one side.

What is the reason? He was one of the highest and greatest scholars, and He ultimately supported the debauchery, stealing, etc., of the Absolute, as being the highest conception. How was this possible? Then I began to pray to the Lord to reveal the fact to me. I couldn’t follow it.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then he said that the flash came, and with that, it also came to him that Chaitanyadev is Kṛṣṇa Himself.

We put forth that we have claim over the environment or over ourselves. ‘I belong to me’—this is false. I am not an independent factor in this world. I am a part and a parcel. I belong to someone; I have got my master. Everything belongs to Him and without any condition. Unconditionally, every atom belongs to the controlling centre. And that is love and goodness.

I shall have to enter that domain as an object, of the subject. There, He is the subject and I am the object here, possessing only a particle of the space there, and that is also at His sweet will.
