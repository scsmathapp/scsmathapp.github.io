Finally, I offer my obeisances to all the readers who open their hearts to the divine teachings presented in this book."},{"class":"b44","text":" I would like to explain the origin of this compilation. Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj has travelled the world twenty-four times over the last eighteen years preaching the teachings of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī Prabhu, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur, and Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj.

Śrīman Mahāprabhu delineated the whole of revealed knowledge using three foundational concepts: sambandha, abhidheya, and prayojan. He summarised these as Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa-bhakti, and Kṛṣṇa-prema. More specifically, sambandha-jñān means understanding Kṛṣṇa, His energies, and their relationships; abhidheya means the practice of pure devotion to Kṛṣṇa; and prayojan means the ultimate necessity of every soul: love for Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur summarises Śrīman Mahāprabhu’s teachings on sambandha, abhidheya, and prayojan in the introductory verse of his <span class=\\"e3\\">Daśa-mūla-tattva</span>, in effect, encapsulating the whole of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava siddhānta in a single verse. <span class=\\"e3\\">Revealed Truth</span> presents Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj’s lectures as an exposition of this verse and the ten principles it summarises."},{"class":"b44","text":" The aim of Revealed Truth is not to publish particular discourses of Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj, as has been done in previous publications, but to expound prominent themes within the compass of Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj’s preaching by weaving together content from numerous lectures with the hope of making the profundity of Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj’s realisations and teachings clearly accessible. To further this end, <span class=\\"e3\\">Revealed Truth’s</span> typographic scheme arrays images, captions, verse translations, and scriptural references beside the text to augment its themes. All translation has been done with reference to commentaries by Śrīla Viśvanāth Chakravartī Ṭhākur, Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur, and other Āchāryas in the Rūpānuga sampradāya."},{"class":"b44","text":" I encourage readers to approach this book with a faithful heart and prayerful mood.

We can understand everything about who we are (sambandha), what the goal of our life should be (prayojan), and how we can attain that (abhidheya) through āmnāya."},{"class":"b69","text":" How āmnāya, revealed knowledge, exists in this world can be understood through the example of the Ganges River. Previously the civilisation of India was called the Gaṅgā-sabhyatā, “The civilisation of the Ganges”. Everyone throughout India has respect for the Ganges and has faith that Mother Ganges comes down to this world from the lotus feet of the Lord in the transcendental world. As the Ganges comes down through the heavens, Lord Śiva takes her on his head, breaks her force, and then allows her to flow gently over the surface of the earth. Everyone understands that the Ganges descends from the Lord’s abode in this way and then flows down from the Himalayas across India to the ocean in the Bay of Bengal, or the Ganga Sagar, as it is known in India. As the Ganges flows across India many dirty things can be found within her waters, but everyone understands that the Ganges never loses her transcendental nature even when she appears dirty materially. Ganges water is understood to come down from the Lord’s lotus feet and to always be fully transcendental. People understand that no matter how dirty her water may appear, the Ganges’ waters spiritual nature is never polluted or removed by anything material. So even though the Ganges appears to be polluted, everyone understands that Ganges water is always spiritually purifying and that even the auspicious breeze blowing off the Ganges brings a spiritual mood of devotion to the conditioned souls of this world."},{"class":"b70","text":" Subtle transmission"},{"class":"b43","text":" Through this example of the Ganges we can understand that when āmnāya descends into this realm it will never lose its transcendental nature, even though it may mix with our material minds, language, and experience. Still, our intelligence cannot conceive of how the Ganges descends from the transcendental realm or how revealed truth appears in this world. To adjust this we can consider that now in the scientific age so many things exist around us that no one could have conceived of in the past. Only now can we conceive that a signal can be broadcast through the ether, picked up by a receiver, and then played on a television or radio in a distant place. Now in the scientific age we understand that transmission can happen through subtle means. We can learn from the work of the scientists that it is not unreasonable to try to connect with the higher transcendental world just because the medium for our connection with the transcendental plane is not physical. The scientists have shown everyone that clear communication is possible through subtle means. So we only need to discover the proper channel of revelation and how we can make ourselves a proper receiver capable of receiving transmission from the transcendental realm. Then everything will be revealed to us."},{"class":"b69","text":" Making ourselves proper receivers begins with faith and prayer. When a house is built it is wired so that electricity is available throughout the house. Without electricity a house is dark at night. But when electricity powers the lights within a house, everything can be seen—what is inside the house and what is outside the house. By ourselves, with only our mundane faculties, we are in darkness and cannot imagine the light of divine life. But if we open our hearts and desire that new light appear there, if we pray that our hearts may be clean enough to receive transcendental knowledge, then happily that knowledge will appear within us. As wires carry electricity, so our hearts have the capacity to receive transmissions from the transcendental realm. Faith and prayer from our heart can bring us new life and light from the transcendental world."},{"class":"b70","text":" Revelation of the Infinite"},{"class":"b43","text":" Our Guru Mahārāj, Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj, once visited a group called the Arya Samaj in West India. A man from this group challenged him, “You say that Kṛṣṇa is infinite, but you also say you can understand Kṛṣṇa and you have knowledge of Kṛṣṇa. You are finite. So how can Kṛṣṇa be infinite? If the finite can know the infinite, then how can it be infinite?” Śrīla Guru Mahārāj quickly responded, “You are right. It is not possible for the finite to know the infinite by its own power. But if Kṛṣṇa cannot make Himself known to the finite, then He is not infinite. The Infinite must also be able to reveal Himself to the finite, otherwise He is not infinite.” That man could not argue with this and was very happily defeated by Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. There is no question whether Kṛṣṇa can reveal Himself to us."},{"class":"b69","text":" The Lord is not powerless. He has the capacity to reveal Himself, and He is merciful. By His mercy Kṛṣṇa descends to this world to fulfil our prayers in so many different forms. Sometimes He Himself comes with His full transcendental paraphernalia, sometimes He sends His Avatārs, and sometimes He sends divinely empowered souls. In all these forms He descends to this world to bestow His affection and divine connection upon the fortunate jīva-souls."},{"class":"b70","text":" Enlightening power"},{"class":"b43","text":" When transcendental knowledge appears in our hearts by the will of Lord Kṛṣṇa, we will develop the capacity to understand our eternal relationship with Him.<span class=\\"e13\\">1</span> Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur said, “Seeing a light bulb shining indicates it is connected to a power source.” When we will see and understand things clearly in our heart we will know we are connected with a source of divine power. It is only necessary for us to give that divine light clear entrance and a clean position in our heart. We are not in control of the flow of revelation, but if we are faithful, submissive, and surrendered, then we can attract revelation’s flow and feel its presence in our hearts. And when the descending flow of transcendental knowledge wants to reveal itself in our hearts it must reveal itself; we will not be able to check it actually."},{"class":"b51","text":" Still, from our present position, we are not able to understand everything."},{"class":"b59","text":" nāyam ātmā pravachanena labhyo<br />na medhayā na bahunā śrutena<br />yam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas<br />tasyaiṣa ātmā vivṛṇute tanuṁ svām"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Kaṭha-upaniṣad: 1.2.23)"},{"class":"b71","text":" Our ordinary mental power, intelligence, and learning do not give us entrance into transcendental reality. Only when the Lord reveals Himself in our hearts can we understand Him. This means we can come to know Him only by surrendering to His enlightening power. And whenever we feel the presence of that type of perfect light-connection in our life we must be happy and think that we are proceeding rightly towards our transcendental destiny. As that happens we will begin to understand everything. But until that happens we can’t really understand anything. So, once we have adjusted ourselves to be faithful receivers of the Lord’s revelation, we need to connect with Him through the proper channel in which His enlightening power flows. Once we have prepared ourselves we must try to connect with the Lord and His āmnāya through the proper channel. Then everything will be revealed in our hearts. It is sure that through the proper connection with the proper channel, āmnāya will appear in our hearts.<span class=\\"e13\\">2</span> We only need to proceed in our spiritual life with faith, with chastity and sincerity, with love and affection, and try to receive transcendental knowledge through the proper channel."},{"class":"b70","text":" Vedic culture"},{"class":"b43","text":" The proper channel means a connection with a Vedic source.

Sometimes people think Vedic culture started when Vedic scriptures were written but this is not the truth. Actually, Vedic culture manifested during the creation of the universe."},{"class":"b69","text":" At the beginning of creation, Brahmā, the first created being within the universe, awoke and found that everything was dark. He could not see anything. Eventually he heard a sound, “Tapa!” In this form of divya-saraswatī, transcendental sound vibration, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa initiated Brahmā. Kṛṣṇa Himself acted as the first Guru of everyone in this mundane world by giving consciousness of Himself to Brahmā, the creator. <span class=\\"e3\\">Tapa</span> means ‘meditate’. Brahmā meditated and Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared in his heart. After this Brahmā could see and also understand what his work was to be. Then he began creating everything within the universe. Later Brahmā gave the consciousness he received from Kṛṣṇa to Nārad Ṛṣi, and Nārad Ṛṣi gave it to Vedavyās. Vedavyās then distributed that transcendental knowledge to everyone.

For seven days his clouds and thunderbolts struck down upon Vraja Dhām. The Vraja-vāsīs became very disturbed. They came to Kṛṣṇa and prayed, “What shall we do, Kṛṣṇa?

Lord Rāmachandra is known as Maryādā Puruṣottam, and Kṛṣṇa is known as Līlā Puruṣottam. Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes focus on love and play; for that reason Kṛṣṇa is known as Līlā Puruṣottam. When the Lord appears as Rāmachandra He follows the rules of the Vedas perfectly, to the extreme. That is the character of Maryādā Puruṣottam. But when Kṛṣṇa appears to taste the love of His devotees, He sometimes does not follow the restrictions of the Vedic religion at all. Still, both Rāmachandra and Kṛṣṇa are Puruṣottam, forms of the Supreme Lord."},{"class":"b44","text":" We must understand that Kṛṣṇa is always the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He never loses His supreme position. Even if He does not follow the Vedic religion that He Himself establishes in the world in His other Avatārs, He is still the Supreme Lord. We can understand this through the example of Bhīṣmadev. Bhīṣmadev had perfect moral character. It is beyond even doubt that Bhīṣmadev could make any Vedic moral transgression. He was respected by everyone in the Vedic society as a Mahājan, a great, exemplary soul. Everyone everywhere knew of him and respected him. In large assemblies of kings, brāhmaṇs, and dignitaries, everyone would give first honour to Bhīṣmadev. Everyone considered Bhīṣmadev to have the highest dignity. But that Bhīṣmadev gives full honour and obeisance to Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b69","text":" Once when Kṛṣṇa came to an assembly of many great persons in which Bhīṣmadev was the guest of honour, Bhīṣmadev stood and said, “When Kṛṣṇa is present here, He must receive first honour from everyone. He is more worshippable than anyone.” Then Bhīṣmadev offered a flower to Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet in front of everyone. At that time Kṛṣṇa had so many wives, so many girlfriends, and so many things. Through Bhīṣmadev’s example everyone accepted that Kṛṣṇa is <span class=\\"e3\\">Lord</span> Kṛṣṇa and He can do anything and everything."},{"class":"b70","text":" Vidhi-mārg and rāga-mārg"},{"class":"b43","text":" There is a great difference between the worship of Nārāyaṇ and His Avatārs, and the worship of Kṛṣṇa. There are so many religious teachings in the world. It is very rare to get Kṛṣṇa consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Vedic religion’s main teaching is that you must be pious; you must follow the rules and regulations (vidhi) of the Vedas for proper social and religious life. The Vedic religion teaches that if your character and behaviour is very clean then you can worship and satisfy the Lord. Respect is ninety per cent of Vedic worship. Vedic religion enables you to respectfully worship the Lord in His form as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Nārāyaṇ, or otherwise. Through mantram and many instruments of worship you can offer your devotion from a distance to the Lord according to the proper rules and regulations."},{"class":"b44","text":" The worship of Kṛṣṇa is very different from the formal worship of Vedic religion. To worship Kṛṣṇa you must offer pure love, affection, and the hankering of your transcendental soul. Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu taught this process and mood of worship, which is known as rāga-mārg. The speciality of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s religion is love and affection. That is the only property used for worship in the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Through attachment to Kṛṣṇa, love and affection for Him develop. Love and affection are most attractive to Kṛṣṇa, and as one’s love and affection for Him grow more and more, Kṛṣṇa becomes more and more satisfied. If someone has love and affection for Kṛṣṇa, then anything and everything they do will be satisfying to Him. Any soul with that type of transcendental property is most fortunate. Persons who prefer vidhi-mārg like to worship Lord Rāmachandra, or Lord Nārāyaṇ, or other Avatārs of the Lord, but persons who prefer the mood of love and affection for the Lord, rāga-mārg, must be attracted to Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" In this way we can understand Kṛṣṇa to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead—Reality the Beautiful. Everything we desire we can find fully within Kṛṣṇa. We want charm, beauty, love, affection, and ecstasy; we want success in our lives. All of these are fully present and alive within Kṛṣṇa consciousness. All ecstatic activity is found in full in the Kṛṣṇa conception. If we will try to search for a reason to serve and worship Kṛṣṇa, then the answer will come that everything we need is fully manifested in an effulgent way in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness we will find everything that we need, so we must worship Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b69","text":" What do we really need? We do not need awe or reverence; we need happiness.

In no other God consciousness and in no other God conception are they fully present. The Rāmachandra conception, the Nārāyaṇ conception, the Baladev conception, all the other Avatārs of Kṛṣṇa—none of Them can give us the same rasa, the same ecstatic relationship with the Lord.<span class=\\"e13\\">27</span>"},{"class":"b70","text":" The emporium of all ecstasy"},{"class":"b43","text":" Why do I say, “No other”?

In other conceptions you may find relationships with God like the fatherhood of Godhead or servitorship to Godhead. We see that there are many other types of relationships with God. But according to rasa-vichār, the science of divine relationships, the sonhood of Godhead is the best."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Supreme Lord’s position is that He is the supreme controller of everything. But if that Supreme Lord can also be controlled by love and affection, that is an even more glorious position. Why? A father bears the burden of maintaining his children. If a father has no guardian, he has to maintain himself and also bear the burden of maintaining his children. A master must maintain his servants. A friend must care for his friends. But a son can have everything; he can have all types of relationships. When a son has a guardian then he can even do wrong and still be protected. If the Absolute Lord performs His Pastimes in a youthful form, He can enjoy all possible relationships. He can have a father or guardian, and under their care He can simply play and enjoy. When the Lord assumes the form of a son, His Pastimes become the Sweet Absolute."},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa is known as Vrajendra Nandan, the son of the king of Vṛndāvan.

That is full-fledged theism, and only in such a conception is all beauty, charm, and ecstasy beautifully playing. Kṛṣṇa is the most beautiful and extremely merciful. So much charm, love, and harmony are existing within the ecstatic Lord of the Kṛṣṇa conception."},{"class":"b69","text":" So many different ecstatic feelings all merge together within Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

It is like <span class=\\"e3\\">Paradise Lost</span>.<span class=\\"e13\\">37</span>"},{"class":"b70","text":" Disembodied life"},{"class":"b43","text":" When a jīva-soul follows his body to its cremation ground or grave, he thinks, “What are my relatives doing? Why are they burning my body? They should keep my body for some more time so I can try again to enter back into it.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" When his body is finally burned or buried, the jīva-soul feels very helpless. He wonders, “Where should I go now?” After his body is cremated the jīva-soul visits his house, his old bedroom, and the homes of his relatives. He sees his son or mother or father crying, and he also feels very sad. He wants to show himself to his relatives, but he cannot. He tries to talk to his relatives, but they cannot hear him talking. Frustrated, he may go back to the cremation ground where his body was. Left without shelter the jīva-soul wanders around and around restlessly. He may stay at the cremation house thinking of his body, and other souls who were also cremated the same day may be there as well. He will see those souls and talk with them. They may be the souls of rickshaw wallahs, or kings, or anything else. In life a rickshaw wallah cannot speak with a king, but when they have left their bodies, they may live together in a tree near their cremation ground."},{"class":"b69","text":" In this way the departed soul lives after his body is cremated, and he feels very hungry and thirsty, although he is unable to eat or drink. The departed soul still has his subtle body, his mental body, which contains all his feelings and desires. So he lives in a very helpless condition: full of desires with no way to satisfy them."},{"class":"b70","text":" Vedic rites for the departed"},{"class":"b50","text":" It is a Vedic rule that three days after a jīva-soul departs his relatives on his daughter’s side offer him some water and milk. This is done through mantram after his body’s cremation."},{"class":"b60","text":" sasa naṣṭo nirālambho vāyu-bhūto nirāśrayam<br />idaṁ kṣīra idaṁ nīra śraddhayā diya te ’pi mām"},{"class":"b43","text":" This mantram means, “You are living now in this cremation field. You have no place to rest and your soul has no formation (<span class=\\"e3\\">nirālambho</span>). Your form is now like a <span class=\\"e3\\">vāyubhūta</span>, an air form like a ghost, and you have no shelter (<span class=\\"e3\\">nirāśrayam</span>). I am your daughter and I am offering you this water and milk. Through this mantram you will receive it and you will feel peaceful.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Mentally the departed jīva-soul then drinks that water and milk. Later his sons offer piṇḍa, traditional sacrificial articles. His sons will become the proprietors of his land, so they must do something good for their father. Ten days after his departure they shave their heads, take a bath in the Ganges or a body of water, put on new cloth, and make an offering to their father or whichever relative of theirs has departed. The departed soul accepts all the offerings through mantram. Through mantram there is communication on the mental plane. The departed soul then feels peaceful, “I have no body or I have no existence among my relatives, but they are still remembering me and they are still doing something good for me. I am not so helpless. Help is coming to me from my relatives.” In this way the departed soul feels some mental peace."},{"class":"b44","text":" After offering piṇḍa the departed soul’s relatives perform a śrāddha ceremony. In remembrance of his necessities—maybe a pair of shoes, an umbrella, some cloth, or some food—they make an offering in his name to a group of brāhmaṇs. There are sixteen items used in this offering. When the departed soul’s relatives supply brāhmaṇs in the ceremony with these necessities, the departed soul receives a year’s supply of his necessities mentally."},{"class":"b69","text":" In this way, on the mental level, the departed soul’s subtle body receives ten or twelve years of food when a group of ten or twelve brāhmaṇs is fed. In his name his relatives feed a group of brāhmaṇs, and all the property they offer is enjoyed by him mentally. Each of his relatives bears witness, “This śrāddha ceremony is the Vedic practice for departed jīva-souls, and I am offering these articles for the benefit of my father”, or mother, or other relative, according to their relationship. Then the śrāddha ceremony is finished. The brāhmaṇs from the ceremony take responsibility for the departed soul’s spiritual advancement and bring some light to him. Within a few days he feels the darkness of his situation leave, and he feels detachment in his mind."},{"class":"b70","text":" The ghost plane"},{"class":"b43","text":" This is the traditional Vedic process. If a departed soul is a Vaiṣṇava, then all of this is not necessary. The best thing that can be done for him is to offer some preparations to the Lord in His Deity form and then serve the Vaiṣṇavas with that prasādam. Serving the Vaiṣṇavas in the name of the departed soul is the best way to help him, and no problems will come to that Vaiṣṇava if a traditional śrāddha ceremony is not held."},{"class":"b44","text":" Anyhow, after his death a departed soul wants to speak with his relatives, but he cannot. At that time his experience is very bitter. Some days after the ceremony for his passing the grief of his relatives begins to fade and the departed soul thinks, “What is this? Now they are forgetting me. I need to move on and choose my future path. Where shall I go?”"},{"class":"b51","text":" When a jīva-soul is not embodied he can move very quickly over the earth. The departed soul begins to search for his previous connections who still may be on the mental plane. He searches for his forefathers or persons from his past life that have already departed. He searches for his former associates and maybe he finds his grandfather seated under a tree meditating in the Himalayas. Even if he finds some of his previous connections, none of them say to him, “Oh, there you are! Come here! Come here!” No one responds to him like that. The other departed jīva-souls he meets in the mental plane look at him innocently. They advise him, “It is natural, your feelings. Our feelings were the same as yours when we first left our previous bodies. Now you should try to understand our sober mood and try to proceed towards a higher destiny.”"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> Mahārāj, there is an Indian lady here who lost her son a few months ago. She is still grieving very much as though it happened yesterday. Will the soul of her son suffer because of this?"},{"class":"b71","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj:</span> That soul may or may not suffer. That soul knows his mother is foolishly crying for him. He knows he cannot go back to her and she cannot see him. Sometimes in that situation a departed soul may avoid his mother. But if he has much affection for her, he may continue to live near her. Also, sometimes a departed soul may take on a shadow form through great concentration with his subtle body. That means he may become a bhūt [ghost]. Through concentration a soul may take the form of a ghost because of his attachment for his previous worldly life and relatives, but he cannot exist in that form for a long time."},{"class":"b70","text":" Mental experience"},{"class":"b43","text":" Generally a departed soul will try to see how he can go towards a higher standard of life. According to his previous karma he gets an opportunity to stay in some place he desires, and he also gets the opportunity to do what he desires. This all happens on the mental level. On the mental level the vision of departed souls is clearer than the vision of humans. Actually, it is the opposite of human vision. Departed souls can see things very far away from them but they cannot see things near to them. If a departed soul thinks of the ocean, the ocean will come to him on the mental level. If a departed soul thinks of a garden, a garden will come before him. Whatever he thinks of will come before him according to his karma (previous experience)."},{"class":"b69","text":" When things come before him, he thinks, “What shall I do with this?” Then he thinks, “What shall I do with this?” If his previous karma is good and he also had some association with sādhus, he will use his thoughts to try to satisfy the Lord. If someone has given him good association and advised him, “O boy, while you are here (in this disembodied mental state) try to meditate”, then he will think, “I am happy when I think of a flower garden so I will meditate on that to satisfy the Lord.” Then he will think of a flower garden, the flower garden will come into his mind, and if he has a proper cultured mood, he will offer flowers from that garden to a Deity mentally. In this way he can offer the fruits of his karma, the qualities of his previous experience, to the Lord according to his cultured mood, and when he will offer that to the Lord he will receive double the satisfaction he would by enjoying it himself. In this way a departed soul is tested on the mental plane and must try to do something positive there."},{"class":"b70","text":" The waves of birth and death"},{"class":"b71","text":" As he is living on the mental plane a departed soul’s previous karma also pushes him forward. On the mental plane there are always waves moving, the waves of janma and mṛtyu, birth and death. These waves are always flowing throughout the mental plane. Generally the souls existing in the mental plane avoid the waves of birth and death. When those waves come to them they try to move out of the way. They do not want to be carried away by those waves to take birth again. The waves of birth and death come like thunder. When departed souls see the waves of birth and death, they think, “These waves will knock me senseless.” When souls on the mental plane see the thunderous wave of birth coming towards them they feel afraid. They know that that thunderous wave will knock them senseless and take them to an unknown destination. They avoid that wave and live in the mental plane according to their karma."},{"class":"b70","text":" Flying to heaven and hell"},{"class":"b43","text":" Mostly, departed souls try to move towards a higher standard of thinking while they are living in the mental plane. If they have a tendency to enjoy and some pious karma (puṇya), then they will feel some sort of air come and push them up to Svargaloka (heaven). In heaven there are many enjoyable things and departed souls enjoy them there according to their karma. The reactions to the actions they did in their previous lives come to them and they enjoy the heavenly environment."},{"class":"b69","text":" If a departed soul has some bad karma, he is taken to an unpleasant environment. There he feels fearful and hungry. He feels burning sensations. He feels as though he is in the middle of a thunderstorm. He feels many varieties of miseries. In India you will see images of nārak [hell]: people being killed, burned, scalped, eaten by vultures, and so on. All these reactions happen to a departed soul in his subtle body on the mental level in hell, and he cries so much as he suffers. According to a soul’s karma he will either suffer in Nārak or enjoy in Svargaloka."},{"class":"b70","text":" Rebirth"},{"class":"b43","text":" When a departed soul’s karma is finished he must again take birth. This is the law. He will not be able to avoid it. It will happen suddenly as though in the meantime. The waves of janma and mṛtyu, birth and death, will come and take him forcibly to his birth. He will be knocked senseless and forced down to the ground of the earth. Unconsciously he will take on the form of a tree or plant and then a fruit. From the fruit he will move into the body of a human, animal, or insect according to the reactions of his karma. If his next body will be a human body, he will take the form of some rice or some food, and in this way move into the body of his future father. From his father’s body he will move into the womb of his mother."},{"class":"b51","text":" Sometimes when a soul is in the womb of his mother, his consciousness will suddenly come back to him. He will see his own form as an ātmā [soul], and he will see that the Paramātmā [Supreme Soul] is living with him.

When the jīva-soul is living in the womb of his mother he has some general consciousness and feelings. When the jīva-soul’s body and senses form within the womb, his awareness begins to come back to him, though it is not so strong, after being knocked senseless by the waves of birth and death. But when he is born and comes out from his mother’s womb, he forgets everything. His next life begins from that moment."},{"class":"b69","text":" Sometimes some persons can see mental pictures of their previous lives even after they have taken on a new body.

She could immediately play and sing very difficult tunes after hearing them only once or twice. She could easily play music that many adults could not play. This quality came to her through her previous karma.

We will see that we are members of the transcendental service world.
