Your senses must have all been destroyed. Otherwise you would have died from the pain of separation from Kṛṣṇa. It is inconceivable. We belong to Him wholesale. He is all-in-all to us, but we can’t see Him. We are forcibly separated from Him. How can we tolerate this?” And Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur once said, “I can’t tolerate separation from Kṛṣṇa any longer.

I would like to taste that.” But only devotees can taste that, so He took the position of Rādhārāṇī to taste Himself as Kṛṣṇa, the central, final, and perfect abode of rasa. Only Rādhārāṇī can taste the maximum rasa, so He has to take Her nature, Her mood, and temperament to taste His own intrinsic ecstasy. For that reason He descended. His first duty was to spread Nām-saṅkīrtan, and the secondary, internal, private duty was to perform svabhajan-vibhajan, to taste His own intrinsic ecstasy in the mood of Rādhārāṇī.

And later He took sannyās and chased after those who were misguided by Māyā Devī in order to save them. At the same time, although He is Kṛṣṇa, He accepted the mood of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. For these two reasons, He left His apparently worldly life: He acted for the welfare of the public and, after finishing that work, spent the next twelve years tasting the very inner aspiration of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and searching after His own inner sweetness.

His mercy is all-embracing. And Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu cannot dismiss His recommendation. Even those who Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu rejected, Nityānanda Prabhu sheltered, and gradually Mahāprabhu had to accept them.

He fully surrendered and identified Himself with Mahāprabhu’s cause. So we must bow down to Nityānanda Prabhu. Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu was merged in tasting the sweetness of Rādhā-Govinda-līlā, and diving deep into that reality, however, at the same time, He wanted to deliver all souls whose hearts had not been devoured by the false notions of renunciation and exploitation.

It is our opinion that because the so-called ‘high-class’ people were so much surcharged with vanity, Nityānanda Prabhu was asked to approach the masses. Because He was ordered to mix with them very familiarly for His preaching purposes, it was found necessary for Him to marry. Otherwise, if He were to have mixed very familiarly with family men, accusations may have been levelled at His standard of renunciation. And to further that purpose, He married. He had to adopt that policy and accept that attitude. And He may have been told to do so by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu; it was not His own decision.

Sūrya Dās gave Him intimate help in His propaganda work, as his house was a good base. And Sūrya Dās, who had two daughters, offered Nityānanda Prabhu his daughter in marriage.

And Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur Prabhupād was also inspired by this action of Nityānanda Prabhu’s to give tridaṇḍa-sannyās to his followers, in contrast to ekadaṇḍa which was formerly current in Bengal.

Indian saints generally preach, “Give up everything, go to a solitary place in the jungle, find a cave, and engage yourself fully in understanding Godhead.” But our Guru Mahārāj was different. Like Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu, he wanted to attack māyā and, like a great general, he declared totalitarian war on illusion and even all other existing conceptions of religion. “Why is there this misunderstanding and misconception?” he thought. “Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa: <span class=\\"e3\\">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam</span>.

Then, its glamour will vanish and the whole world will come to join the campaign of divine love of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu.” This was the same spirit with which Nityānanda Prabhu canvassed the fallen souls of this world, in His attempt to take them to the lotus feet of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu."}]},{"title":"Mad Nimāi Paṇḍit","paragraphs":[{"class":"b34","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b47","text":" Mad Nimāi Paṇḍit"},{"class":"b43","text":" At the time of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s advent, Bengal had fallen far away from Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Nimāi used to show His formal respect to Advaita Prabhu every time They met, so Advaita made a plan to stop this, and thought to Himself, “I shall see how clever You are.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" He left Nabadwīp, went to Śāntipur, and began to preach against the devotional school. The news came to Nimāi that Advaita Āchārya, after such a long time as a devotee, was preaching against the devotional school. He was preaching that jñān, knowledge, is higher than devotion. “Devotion makes the Lord far away”, He argued, “and knowledge tries to bring Him very near. With knowledge, one thinks, ‘I want to experience You, O Lord.’ And devotion says ‘He is adhokṣaja: transcendental. He can’t be traced by our senses.’ So devotion makes Him far away by saying, ‘It is only His sweet will that may connect us.’ But according to the path of knowledge, the supreme authority is within you, in your heart. The devotional school is clearly secondary.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" “Don’t kill that old man!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In this way, Advaita Āchārya began to preach. And when that reached the ears of Nimāi Paṇḍit, He went with Nityānanda to punish Advaita. They jumped into the Ganges and swam all the way to Śāntipur, where they found Advaita Āchārya. Nimāi confronted Him: “What are You doing, Āchārya? Why have You invited Me to come here? With Ganges water and tulasī leaves, You prayed for Me to appear, and now You are making fun of Me? You are speaking against devotion, against Me? What is the matter with You?” In this way, Nimāi Paṇḍit began to punish Advaita. He began to slap Him. The old wife of Advaita Āchārya began to cry, “What are You doing? Don’t kill that old man!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Nityānanda Prabhu was smiling, and Haridās Ṭhākur, perplexed, was standing at a little distance trying to understand, “What is the matter?” Then Advaita Āchārya Prabhu felt great satisfaction. He said, “I have taught You a lesson now—You have come to punish Me. You are defeated—I have gained victory over You!” Advaita Prabhu began to dance. “Today I have defeated You, My Lord! You had to punish Me. Where has that formal respect You were always showing Me gone now?” In this way, Advaita Āchārya rejoiced, and offered Mahāprabhu a feast of śāk, His favourite delicacy."},{"class":"b69","text":" The Lord gave so much grace to Advaita Prabhu that although He was an old scholar and Āchārya, He was punished with slaps. It is not possible to punish or dishonour anyone we respect, but only our intimate friends. Disrespect and dishonour is possible only when there is great intimacy. Pure devotees want punishment. “Punish us!” they pray, but punishment from the high quarter is not very cheap."},{"class":"b70","text":" Advaita’s mystic poem"},{"class":"b51","text":" Many years later, just before Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu began to manifest His final Pastimes of divine ecstasy, Advaita Āchārya Prabhu wrote some mystic lines of poetry which He sent to the Lord through Jagadānanda Paṇḍit:"},{"class":"b60","text":" bāulake kahiha,—loka haila bāula<br />bāulake kahiha,—hāṭe nā vikāya chāula<br />bāulake hahiha,—kāye nāhika āula<br />bāulake kahiha,—ihā kahiyāchhe bāula"},{"class":"b50","text":" Tell our Prabhu, who acts as madmen do,<br />that everyone has lost their sanity,<br />And rice once high in price has no value.<br />In love of God, half-crazed humanity<br />neglects this world and all they once held dear;<br />tell Him a madman brings this to His ear."},{"class":"b71","text":" When Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu read that mystic poem, His mood became serious. Svarūp Dāmodar was there: “What is written here?” he said. Mahāprabhu replied, “I do not know what is the real meaning, but Advaita Āchārya is a great ‘worshipper’, and a certain class of ‘worshippers’ are accustomed to think, ‘We shall invite the Deity, and for some time we shall try to keep Him here for worship. Then, when we are finished with our worship, finally we shall bid Him adieu.’ Perhaps Advaita thinks, ‘Now it is time for the Deity to go.’ I don’t know what is the real meaning, but perhaps this is His purpose.” Svarūp Dāmodar took the poem, read it, and became very thoughtful: “Oh. Advaita Prabhu is saying that the requirements for Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s appearance have been fulfilled, and now, He is no longer needed to preach the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa as the incarnation for this age. The Avatār’s duty is finished, and so He may go.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" The last twelve years"},{"class":"b44","text":" After this, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu remained within this world for twelve more years, but not as before. His mood was quite changed. From that day on, He felt great separation from Kṛṣṇa in the mood of Rādhārāṇī. Divine madness became predominant in Him and His social connection was almost closed. Rāmānanda Rāy and Svarūp Dāmodar were His attendants at that time. He no longer kept any social connections; the fire within Him was burning—the fire of separation. He was absorbed in Rādhārāṇī’s search for Śrī Kṛṣṇa after Kṛṣṇa left Vṛndāvan. In that mood of divine madness, He spent twelve years in a closed room within the house compound of Kāśī Miśra."},{"class":"b44","text":" Sometimes at night, unconsciously crossing the boundary wall, He would run to meet Lord Jagannāth. When Svarūp Dāmodar and His other attendants would suddenly find that no sound of Kṛṣṇa’s Name could be heard within His room, they would begin searching: “Mahāprabhu is not there, where is He?” Sometimes they would find Him fallen before the main gate of the Jagannāth Temple, His legs and hands drawn within His body like the limbs of a tortoise drawn within its shell. A very sweet fragrance could be detected emanating from Him, and the cows would flock there, smelling His body. While Mahāprabhu was lying in His trance, He was internally experiencing the Pastimes of Rādhā and Govinda with the gopīs in Govardhan. At that time, Svarūp Dāmodar and the others tried their best to revive Him from His trance by chanting the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Mahāprabhu was roused, He complained, “What have you done? I was enjoying a most happy experience there but by raising a clamour, you have drawn me down here.” And what raised a clamour? The chanting of “Hare Kṛṣṇa”. And who was chanting the Name of Kṛṣṇa? Svarūp Dāmodar and others of his calibre. The depth of the experience of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu in His divine trance was so great that He took the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa to be noise. So, we may chant the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa, and that may be simply noise. From another angle of vision, however, it may be seen that Kṛṣṇa-nām is of such immense value that it was given preference over direct participation in Kṛṣṇa-līlā. But the direction given to us by our Āchāryas, the spiritual preceptors of our line, is that we should consider our own chanting to be merely noise."},{"class":"b69","text":" One day, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu was wandering near the seashore. A girl was fervently singing in praise of Lord Jagannāth, and Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu ran straight towards that sound. He began running through thickets of dangerous thorns. Then Govinda, His attendant, somehow stopped Him. When He understood everything, He said, “Oh, a girl is singing? Govinda saved my life.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" Half-man in ecstasy"},{"class":"b44","text":" Sometimes He would suddenly feel that Kṛṣṇa is playing with the gopīs in the Yamunā. In that mood He would jump into the ocean, crying, “Kṛṣṇa!” He jumped there and became unconscious, as the waves were playing with Him. Finding Him gone, His devotees would wonder, “Where is Mahāprabhu?” and, headed by Svarūp Dāmodar, would begin their searching. Once, the night was almost over and they still couldn’t find Him. At last a fisherman came running, half-mad, chanting, “Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “What is the matter?” Svarūp Dāmodar asked. The fisherman replied, “Every night I catch fish, but tonight I threw out my net and caught something very heavy. When I began pulling it in, I thought it was a big fish, but when I took it on shore I found a big human figure, and when I went to remove the body from my net, somehow I touched Him; now I am half-mad.” Then, Svarūp Dāmodar said, “You must have seen our Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu?” “No, I have seen Him before”, the fisherman said, “He has a beautiful figure. It is not Him. It is something else.” Svarūp Dāmodar told him, “Anyhow, try to show us where He is.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" They went and saw the long figure of the Lord, His joints dislocated, lying on the sands, senseless. Svarūp Dāmodar and the others began to chant the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa in His ear, until He came to His senses. At that time Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu began to describe the līlā of Kṛṣṇa that He had seen in His trance. In this way, after Advaita Āchārya’s poetry was sent to Him, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu lived His last twelve years in the mood of intense separation that Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī felt for Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b70","text":" Mad Nimāi Paṇḍit"},{"class":"b44","text":" This intense degree of divine madness was exhibited by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu in His last days on this earth. But even in His life in Nabadwīp, when Mahāprabhu was the great boy-scholar Nimāi Paṇḍit, everyone thought He had become mad after He had returned from Gayā and had begun showing signs of devotion to Kṛṣṇa. The normal-thinking men of the day said: “This Nimāi Paṇḍit was a good man, a gentleman, but after returning from Gayā, He is totally changed, and is doing so many undesirable things. He wants to preach so many new ideas. What is this? He has become a madman. He doesn’t care for any rules and regulations, social customs, or ancient scriptures—only ‘Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa.’ Before, He was normal, but recently He has become abnormal. Of course, He has a powerful intellect. When He was a professor, He did not care for the scholarship of even the greatest of paṇḍits. He easily defeated the champion scholar, Keśava Kāśmīrī, and many others. But now we have lost Him. Now He is different. He does not care for the brāhmaṇs or the scriptures we follow. He has a new opinion, and He is presenting that to the world. His ways are incomprehensible.” The neighbours complained to His mother, Śachī Devī: “Śachī Devī, what is this? Nimāi was not like this before; now He doesn’t care for us anymore. He even has no charm for His wife. What has He become? You are the daughter of a gentleman, but just see your misfortune! What to do? The fact is this, Śachī, your only son, who was so brilliant, has become mad. You must arrange for proper medical treatment.” Then, Śachī Devī called for the kavirāj, the doctor."},{"class":"b44","text":" The doctor made an arrangement for a small, brick bathing tank to be filled up with Viṣṇu oil, which is supposed to be a very cooling thing. And Nimāi Paṇḍit was asked to bathe in that tank. He did so, and suddenly began laughing and playing in the tank. As He was diving and swimming in the oil, He was laughing madly. At that time, Śrīvās Ṭhākur arrived for a visit and asked, “How is Nimāi Paṇḍit?” Śachī Devī told him, “Just see my misfortune! My Nimāi has become completely mad. I called for the doctor and he arranged for this treatment.” As she showed Śrīvās how Nimāi was playing in the tank, he asked, “What is this?” Śachī replied, “My neighbours advised me to do this.” Śrīvās said, “You are a very gentle lady. You do not know how to deal with others. What Nimāi has—I want! Your boy has Kṛṣṇa-prema, and I want a drop of that. If only we are allowed to live a few days longer, we shall have the opportunity of seeing many wonderful Pastimes of Kṛṣṇa.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, Nimāi became sober for the time being and told Śrīvās, “If you had also remarked that I was mad, then I would have run to the Ganges and finished My life. At least you have understood what I am; that is My solace, Śrīvās. If you would have told the public, “He is mad”, then I would have found that there is no man here to accept what I have come to give, so I must enter the river and drown myself without hesitation.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Before Nimāi Paṇḍit went to Gayā, He was a big scholar. When He returned from Gayā surcharged with devotion, He began to explain grammar again, as before, but now He would show Kṛṣṇa in the grammar. He would give interpretations of the roots of Sanskrit grammar which showed the relationship between Sanskrit and Kṛṣṇa. He explained that sound is only a vibration, and vibration means the potency of Kṛṣṇa. It is the potency of Kṛṣṇa that makes everything pure, that makes everything move. If that potency is withdrawn, everything is dead and gone. In this way, Nimāi Paṇḍit wanted to explain grammar in terms of Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, His students became very much disturbed. “What is this!” they thought. “We have come to learn Sanskrit from Nimāi Paṇḍit, but our academic requirements will not be satisfied now. Still, the coaching we got from Him is never to be had anywhere else, so we can’t abandon Him. But how to improve the style of His teaching?” They went to the previous teacher of Nimāi Paṇḍit, Gaṅgā Dās Paṇḍit. He had been Nimāi’s tutor in His childhood. Gaṅgā Dās said, “You are all fortunate to be students of Nimāi Paṇḍit. He is such a nice professor. What is your complaint?” The students said, “We were very much pleased by studying under Nimāi Paṇḍit. But now, since He has returned from Gayā, He is explaining everything in quite a new way. He teaches Sanskrit in terms of the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa. He understands a very high philosophy, but that won’t serve our purpose of studying grammar. It is certainly valuable, but it will not help our studies. Please ask Him to change His ways. He has regard for you because you are His teacher. Only you can influence Him.” “All right”, he said, “Ask Him to see me tomorrow.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" The students went to Nimāi Paṇḍit and told Him, “Your former professor has called for You. He wants to see You.” Nimāi said, “Yes, I shall go and see him.” Later that day, He went to Gaṅgā Dās Paṇḍit, and offered His respectful obeisances. Gaṅgā Dās said: “How are You my boy? I am happy to hear that You went to Gayā and performed Your religious duties for Your ancestors. This is all very good, but what is the matter? Your students are complaining to me. Is it true that You do not care to teach them properly? Why don’t You care to teach them as You did before? They all appreciate Your teachings, but after returning from Gayā You have adopted a novel style of teaching. Don’t continue this, I say—teach them properly. I hear from the people that You have become a devotee. But were Your forefathers not devotees? Of course, You have become a devotee of an extraordinary type. But don’t go astray. What You speak about devotion seems unnecessary—that is not really grammar. Do You think You are giving new light with Your new meanings? Do You think Your former professors were all idiots? What do You have to say?” Nimāi was silent. “All right then. Don’t go astray. Remain calm and follow Your predecessors and teach the boys well, so that we will not have to hear any complaints against You in the future. Your students won’t go to any other school. They are very fond of You, so teach them well.” Then, Nimāi Paṇḍit took the dust of His teacher’s feet and told him, “Yes, I shall try to obey your order. By dint of your footdust, no one can challenge Me in scholarship. Don’t worry. I shall teach them well.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" “Why should I worship Kṛṣṇa?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" A few days later, Nimāi Paṇḍit began to chant the name “gopī, gopī” while He was in a trance of devotion. Some big scholars that held a high social position went to Him and said, “Nimāi Paṇḍit! You were a big paṇḍit and now You are a devotee. That doesn’t matter, but why do You chant the name ‘gopī gopī’? Take the Name of Kṛṣṇa. According to the scriptures, that will bring You some benefit. But You are chanting ‘gopī gopī’. What benefit will You get from that? You are mad.” Nimāi said, “Who is this Kṛṣṇa? Why should I worship Him? He is a dacoit and a woman-hunter!” And Nimāi picked up a stick and chased them away."},{"class":"b44","text":" Later they began to talk among themselves, saying, “Nimāi Paṇḍit has become stark mad. We went to speak something good to Him, and He came with a stick to kill us! We are not sons of ordinary men. We have our high position in society and our family dignity. We will show Him!” They began a conspiracy to teach Nimāi Paṇḍit a good lesson by giving Him a good beating."},{"class":"b52","text":" At that time, Nimāi suddenly cried out: “I took the greatest measures to deliver these wretched souls, but I see now that they are simply creating more sins by abusing Me and conspiring to punish Me. Why have I come? What will be effective in delivering them? I shall have to take the role of a sannyāsī. Otherwise, they will think that I am simply one of them, a householder. But if I become a sannyāsī, a preacher, then they may have some respect. They will say, ‘We are all householders, He has become a sannyāsī. He should be revered.’ Then, from that reverence, they will get some benefit. Otherwise, they will have to go to hell for thinking that I am an ordinary man. To create some respect, so they may benefit, I shall have to accept the role of a sannyāsī.” And He revealed to Nityānanda Prabhu and a few others, “On the last day of the first month of this year, I shall take sannyās.”"}]},{"title":"A Tragedy of Separation","paragraphs":[{"class":"b34","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b47","text":" A Tragedy of Separation"},{"class":"b43","text":" According to solar calculation, it was on the day of Makara Saṅkrānti, an auspicious conjunction of the stars, that Nimāi Paṇḍit went to Katwa to take sannyās, the renounced order of life.

Those who believed that material nature is the highest principle, and that consciousness is a product of matter, began to abuse Nimāi Paṇḍit. He thought, “I came to deliver the lowest of men, but if they commit offences against Me, there will not be hope for their upliftment.” Suddenly, He said, “I came with that medicine which gives the greatest relief, but now I find that their disease is rapidly growing worse and seems beyond treatment. It will take its own course towards doom. The patients are committing offences by abusing their doctor. They are making arrangements to insult Me. They take it that I am a family man—their nephew. They take Me as one of them. I came with the best medicine for the present degraded age, but now I find that they are plotting against Me. Now they are doomed. At least I have to show them that I am not one of them.” He thought, “I shall leave family life and take sannyās and wander from village to village, town to town, preaching the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa.” That was His decision, and within a few days He went to take sannyās at Katwa from Keśava Bhāratī Mahārāj."},{"class":"b69","text":" Just the day before He left to take sannyās, from the afternoon until the evening, there was a spontaneous gathering of devotees in the home of Nimāi Paṇḍit. Every year in Bengal, that day was celebrated as Lakṣmī Pūjā, worship of the Goddess of fortune, when special cakes are prepared and distributed.

Śrīdhar came to see Him late at night to offer Him a choice pumpkin. And Nimāi thought, “I have spent almost My whole life snatching so many things from him, and now, on this last night he has brought this wonderful pumpkin.

I sing the glories of that beautiful golden God, the giver of divine love.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" Mahāprabhu’s sannyās"},{"class":"b44","text":" The scene was at Katwa. Four hundred and seventy-four years ago, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu took sannyās. He was young and beautiful, with a tall figure. He was only twenty-four and had beautiful curling hair. A barber was asked to shave Him, and approached Him, but then withdrew. The barber could not venture to touch Nimāi’s body. He began to cry. “How can I remove such beautiful hair from such a beautiful head?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" And so many others were also crying aloud, “What a horrible thing is being done here! Who is the creator of this sannyās? Who is so hard-hearted that he created the sannyās-āśram, where one must give up all that is near and dear and go from door to door, begging, leaving his own friends and relatives crying helplessly? What is this creation of the Supreme? Is it logical? Is it a happy thing? It is most cruel!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Nimāi Paṇḍit was smiling. After the barber was ordered repeatedly, somehow he was forced to shave Nimāi’s head. At first, he could not venture to touch His hair, saying, “I can’t touch Him.” But at last, he had to do the service of shaving the beautiful, curling hair of the beautiful face of the twenty-four-year-old genius boy. He began with his shears. Some people could not stand the scene. Some even became mad. In the midst of the weeping, wailing, and crying of the threatening mob, it was done."},{"class":"b44","text":" Nimāi Paṇḍit was senseless. After being only half-shaved, He stood up and began chanting in kīrtan and dancing in ecstatic joy. After He was shaved, the barber promised, “I will never again shave anyone with this hand! I would rather live by begging. This is my last service as a barber.” After this, that barber took up the occupation of a sweetmaker."},{"class":"b44","text":" Ultimately Nimāi’s appeals pacified the mob, and a little before noon the inevitable gradually came: the sannyās function was performed. Chandraśekhar Āchārya, the maternal uncle of Nimāi Paṇḍit, was deputed to take charge of the rituals in the ceremony of sannyās. When the mantra was to be conferred, Nimāi Paṇḍit asked Keśava Bhāratī, “Is this the mantra you will give Me? I heard it in a dream.” He whispered the mantra in the ear of His Guru who accepted, saying, “Yes, this is the mantra I shall give You.” Then that mantra was given."},{"class":"b44","text":" And the name of this sannyāsī was not given in an ordinary way either. A most peculiar name came through Keśava Bhāratī: ‘Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya’. None of the ten names generally given to sannyāsīs was given to Nimāi Paṇḍit, but the name that was given to Him was ‘Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya’. As soon as they heard that name, the mob began to cry, “Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya Mahāprabhu kī jay!” “All glories to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The father of Śrīnivās Āchārya was a class-friend of Nimāi Paṇḍit. On his way to his father-in-law’s house, he heard that Nimāi Paṇḍit had come to take sannyās. He ran there, and seeing everything, he became dumb—he was devastated and went half-mad. After that, nothing came from his mouth but “Chaitanya!” After he heard the name ‘Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya’, whatever anyone said to him, he would only say, “Chaitanya!” He became mad. After that, his name became Chaitanya Dās. His former name vanished, and everyone used to call him Chaitanya Dās. He could not stand the scene of Nimāi Paṇḍit’s sannyās."},{"class":"b69","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, newly dressed in red robes, embraced His Guru, and both of them began to dance, chanting the Name of Kṛṣṇa. After some time, the meaning of the name was given. Keśava Bhāratī Mahārāj said, “‘Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya’ means that You arouse Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the entire world. You have descended to make all people Kṛṣṇa conscious. So the most suitable name for You cannot but be ‘Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya’.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" The nectarean world"},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu was very cheerful, thinking, “I am going to relieve so many souls from their eternal misery and affliction. I have promised to deliver the whole world from this ocean of misery and take them to the nectarean world, and now I am going to accept that task.” He was cheerful, but everyone around Him was diving in the ocean of despair and sorrow."},{"class":"b69","text":" Some scholars stress that Chaitanya Mahāprabhu took sannyās from Keśava Bhāratī, who was a māyāvādī, an impersonalist. But although Keśava Bhāratī may have externally showed himself in that way, it is seen that by coming in connection with Mahāprabhu, he became a devotee. Otherwise, we may also think that he was a devotee who came in the garb of an impersonalist to help the preaching of Mahāprabhu by assisting Him with the social formality of taking sannyās. At that time, all over India, māyāvādī sannyāsīs had greater recognition than Vaiṣṇava sannyāsīs, and Keśava Bhāratī was already situated in that post. Mahāprabhu took the garb of a sannyāsī from him for His own purpose, to help His preaching activity. All these things may be explained in different ways. In any case, after Mahāprabhu took sannyās, Keśava Bhāratī began to sing and dance with Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. He joined in saṅkīrtan and was immediately converted."},{"class":"b70","text":" Kṛṣṇa conception: union in separation"},{"class":"b44","text":" In this way, the sannyās of Nimāi Paṇḍit took place. What is the meaning of His sannyās? Is it redundant, auxiliary, or a necessary part of spiritual advancement? Is it desirable? Although apparently undesirable, still it has its necessity. In the Kṛṣṇa conception of theism, there is a deep-rooted correlation between union with the Lord and separation from Him. Without separation, union cannot be deep-rooted. The pain of separation can enter into the depth of the heart much more than cheerfulness. Such apprehension increases our satisfaction. The greater our want, the greater our satisfaction. This is especially true in love affairs. If there is no necessity of a thing, it has no value. This principle is found everywhere. A glass of water is ordinary, but according to the degree of its necessity, its value will increase. So the degree of necessity is most important. Necessity means separation. Necessity independent of fulfilment is separation, hunger."},{"class":"b69","text":" Separation plays the most important part in both Nabadwīp and Vṛndāvan-līlā. How many years of union were there between Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs? Kṛṣṇa was only in Vṛndāvan from the age of seven years up to the age of twelve: five years. Then, He went to Mathurā. Of course, it is mentioned in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Padma-purāṇa</span> that in peculiar or extraordinary cases, growth should be measured by multiplying by one and a half. So when Kṛṣṇa is eight years old, He should be considered twelve. When He is twelve, He should be considered eighteen years of age. So according to His growth, Kṛṣṇa was in Vṛndāvan from the age of twelve to eighteen, but according to His years, from the age of seven to twelve."},{"class":"b70","text":" The depth of divine love"},{"class":"b44","text":" He stayed in Dvārakā for a long time; altogether He lived here on this earth for one hundred and twenty-five years. After He left Vṛndāvan at the age of twelve, the pangs of separation were felt by the gopīs throughout their whole lives. Their long, long separation has made their devotion so dignified; the test of separation shows whether love is real. Such a long-standing separation and such a great test has never been found in history; still, the depth of their love did not diminish. Rather, an inconceivable, ever-increasing depth of divine love was found there."},{"class":"b44","text":" And in both Nabadwīp and Vṛndāvan, the background is almost similar. In Nabadwīp, to gain victory over the opposition party, Mahāprabhu left His household life. And in Vṛndāvan-līlā it is also similar. The opposition in Vṛndāvan-līlā came from Mathurā in the form of Agha, Baka, Pūtanā, Tṛnāvarta, and other demons who were being sent by King Kaṁsa. To uproot the opposition, Kṛṣṇa had to go to Mathurā. And when He went there, He found that the opposition was widespread. Kaṁsa’s father-in-law, Jarāsandha, Kālayavana, Śiśupāl, Dantavakra, and many others were inimical to Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa promised the gopīs that after finishing His enemies, He would return to Vṛndāvan to play peacefully with them. To uproot the opposition party, Kṛṣṇa had to go away. And He told the gopīs in Kurukṣetra, “I have some other enemies; after finishing with them, I will be reunited with you.” That sort of hope was given to the gopīs in Kurukṣetra."},{"class":"b69","text":" Here also, to conquer the opposition party, Mahāprabhu had to leave Nabadwīp. Later, after His conquest of all the Indian scholars and religionists of different positions and creeds, after five years, when He returned to Nabadwīp, everyone was transformed. The mass approached Him madly. It is difficult to conceive with what madness the mass approached Śrī Chaitanyadev, the child of their own village."},{"class":"b70","text":" The Ganges—filled with human heads"},{"class":"b44","text":" They crossed the Ganges. The whole Ganges, as far as it could be seen, was filled with human heads. They were running towards Him from all directions in such a way that the jungles were cleared by human feet. For a few days, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu stayed nearby in Vidyā Nagar, and then went towards Vṛndāvan, singing the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa. Thousands of devotees were running behind Him, digging up the earth to take the dust of His holy feet, and huge pits were being created."},{"class":"b69","text":" For about eighteen years Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu led a scholarly life as Nimāi Paṇḍit. After that, for about six years, He wandered through the length and breadth of India, including Vṛndāvan. The last eighteen years of His life, He remained in Jagannāth Purī continuously. For the first six years of His sannyās, He mixed with the general public. The last twelve years of His life, He almost retired from the whole human society and engaged Himself deeply in tasting the union in separation of Rādhā-Govinda. And many extraordinary symptoms of ecstasy which have never been experienced anywhere, nor even heard of, were expressed by Him. Separation can produce such wonderful effects in the body and mind."},{"class":"b70","text":" Śrī Gaurāṅga-avatār"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrī Gaurāṅga-avatār has twofold characteristics: the apparent reason for His advent is to deliver the people in general from sin, and to give them the highest attainment of life—to take them towards Vṛndāvan, Vraja-līlā, by giving the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa. This is actually the function of the Yuga-avatār, the incarnation of Godhead for the age. The Lord comes to distribute the divine sound and to show how one can reach the highest position through divine sound. Still, He had another purpose to fulfil. Once in Brahmā’s day—in a special Kali-yuga—Kṛṣṇa Himself comes in the mood of Rādhārāṇī to search Himself. He wants to taste the mood of Rādhārāṇī, to understand the nature of Her inner hankering for Kṛṣṇa, how She can taste the sweetness of Kṛṣṇa by Her mood, and what is the joy She derives."},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa wanted to have some experience of why Rādhārāṇī is so mad for Him. He thought, “What is there in Me that makes Her so immeasurably mad for Me? What sweetness can She draw from Me? I can’t ascertain it.” He wanted to mould Himself in the mood of Śrī Rādhikā and try to taste His own self from that temperament. So He came as Śrī Chaitanya."},{"class":"b44","text":" When He conceived of such an incarnation, and proposed His idea to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, we are told that Rādhārāṇī, on Her part, said, “Sometimes You will madly roll on the earth, taking My Name, but I won’t be able to tolerate it. I shall cover Your body with My golden form. I won’t allow You to roll on the earth. I shall cover You with My embrace.” So it is said by those who know the ontological aspect of Śrī Chaitanyadev, “I offer my respects to Śrī Chaitanyadev, whose mood and colour is Rādhārāṇī’s and whose inner self is Kṛṣṇa searching for Himself, tasting Himself, and trying to understand why Rādhārāṇī is mad to taste Him and what sort of sweetness She finds in Him (<span class=\\"e3\\">Rādhā-bhāva-dyuti-suvalitaṁ naumi Kṛṣṇa-svarūpam</span>).”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu remained in this world for forty-eight years. In the last twelve years of His life, He engaged Himself with deep attention in tasting Himself. Just as everyone is mad to taste sweetness, Kṛṣṇa, sweetness personified, is also mad to taste Himself."},{"class":"b51","text":" Introspection means to know oneself. Consciousness can know consciousness. And just as one can feel his own body, or consciousness can conceive of itself, ecstasy can also taste ecstasy. This is confirmed by Svarūp Dāmodar Prabhu, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s personal secretary, who is considered to be Lalitā Sakhī, the nearest friend of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī in the Pastimes of Kṛṣṇa. He has said what Śrī Chaitanyadev is:"},{"class":"b64","text":" rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī śaktir asmād<br />ekātmānāv api bhuvi purā deha-bhedaṁ gatau tau<br />chaitanyākhyaṁ prakaṭam adhunā tad dvayaṁ chaikyam āptaṁ<br />rādhā-bhāva-dyuti-suvalitaṁ naumi kṛṣṇa-svarūpam"},{"class":"b43","text":" “I worship Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, who is Kṛṣṇa Himself, enriched with the emotions and radiance of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. As the predominating and predominated moieties, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are eternally one, with separate individual identities. Now They have again united as Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya. This inconceivable transformation of the Lord’s internal pleasure-giving potency has arisen from the loving affairs of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In this verse, Svarūp Dāmodar says that the Pastimes of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and those of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu are parallel and eternal. Whether winter is first and summer follows, or summer is first and winter follows is difficult to say. Similarly, in the eternal Pastimes of the Lord, the movement is rolling in a circle. Therefore, Svarūp Dāmodar says, “Whether Chaitanya-avatār is first and Kṛṣṇa-avatār is next, or Kṛṣṇa-avatār is first and Chaitanya-avatār is next is difficult to say—both are eternal.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" And who is Śrī Rādhā? She is the development of the sweetness that springs from Kṛṣṇa Himself. That sweetness, in a developed form as Rādhā, springs up from within Kṛṣṇa; Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is a particular potency coming out of Kṛṣṇa Himself: hlādinī-śakti. So Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa cannot be conceived of as separate entities; the two of Them are one and the same. Still, we are told that in ancient times They divided into two. And then again, both of Them combine as Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, whose lustre and mood is that of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and whose nature and reality within is Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s. Fire and heat cannot be separated; sun and light cannot exist separately. They are one and the same. The Absolute Truth is one absolute substance (Advaya-jñān), but sometimes Rādhā and Govinda show Themselves as divided and again They are united. When They are together, They are enjoying each other, and sometimes They experience a painful separation without the possibility of union. That is Their divine nature."},{"class":"b51","text":" Śrī Rupa Goswāmī explains this as follows:"},{"class":"b60","text":" aher iva gatiḥ premṇah svabhāva-kuṭilā bhavet<br />ato hetor ahetoś cha yūnor māna udañchati"},{"class":"b71","text":" He says that just as a serpent naturally moves in a crooked way, in a zigzag way, the nature of love is naturally crooked. It is not straight. So the concerned parties quarrel, sometimes with cause and sometimes without cause, and separation comes. Separation is necessary for the transcendental Pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b70","text":" The pangs of separation"},{"class":"b44","text":" There are four kinds of separation: pūrva-rāga, māna, pravās, and prema-vaichittya. Pūrva-rāga means before meeting. This is found when Rādhā and Govinda are not actually meeting, but somehow one has come in remote connection with the other’s Name, portrait, or something of that nature. When Rādhā hears Kṛṣṇa’s Name or the sound of the flute—no real meeting is there, but there is some connection. The sound of Kṛṣṇa’s flute, a picture of Kṛṣṇa, or Kṛṣṇa’s Name may bring about pūrva-rāga. And Kṛṣṇa may experience something similar by hearing the sound of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s Name. In this way, there are pangs of separation, but no actual meeting. The Name is so sweet that He can’t contain Himself; She can’t contain Herself."},{"class":"b44","text":" When the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa enters within Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s ear, She becomes perturbed, thinking, “Is a Name as sweet as this possible within this world?” This is Her reaction, and She experiences this also. She feels, “I can’t meet Him.” A pang of separation comes within Her heart. That is pūrva-rāga: the pain of separation that comes before meeting."},{"class":"b69","text":" Māna is another kind of separation. Māna means that when meeting, there is some difference between Them in trifling matters. This is the very nature of love. Therefore, Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī says that love moves in a curved way like a serpent. It is not diseased, but this is the nature of the path of love. Sometimes with a trifling cause, or with no cause, a feeling comes that, “He is neglecting Me; He wants to avoid Me.” And thereby Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī thinks, “I don’t want His company.” Although cent per cent appreciation is there, still, for the time being, some opposing sentiments spring up from underground; a clash comes in the sentiments of the two, and one wants to avoid the company of the other."},{"class":"b70","text":" Transcendental jealousy"},{"class":"b44","text":" In prema-vaichittya, jealousy rises to such a degree that although They are already together, still some sort of thought comes within and makes Them think that They are far away from each other. These different kinds of separation are found only in the madhura-rasa. Prema-vaichittya is that condition which arises when Kṛṣṇa is there and Rādhārāṇī is just nearby, but seeing Her own shadow reflected on the body of Kṛṣṇa, She is so jealous that She thinks that it is another lady. So, great pangs of separation come within Her, and She thinks, “What is this? Another lady is there!” Her mind revolts. But Her friend, Lalitā, is warning Her, “What are You saying? It is only Your own image reflected there. Can’t You see it?” Then Rādhārāṇī comes to Her consciousness. She particularly notices, “Oh, it is My own shadow.” Then that feeling is immediately gone. This is an example of prema-vaichittya. These are extremely high transcendental subjects, and although this is not to be discussed in details, this is the nature of divine love in union and separation. Both are interdependent, for one cannot stay without the other, and separation is created willingly to enhance union."},{"class":"b44","text":" Another kind of separation is called pravās. There are two types of pravās: one is when the separation is for a limited time; another is when one has left the country for a far-off place, as when Kṛṣṇa went to Mathurā to attend to other duties. These are the four types of separation pangs between the lover and the beloved."},{"class":"b44","text":" Of course, these transcendental topics are very high, and we should not indulge in them carelessly, for if we project mundane characteristics into the higher plane, our future realisation will be harmed. Our mundane experience will tend to take us down, so we must proceed with caution. What we conceive of at present is not to be found in the plane of Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes—it is a far higher plane of existence than the realm of our experience. Our vision is adulterated. We have only an alloyed conception of the original thing. We must keep this in mind, and with this caution we may deal with these things."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is safer to deal with the topics of the separation between Rādhā and Govinda than with Their union. Of course, we must understand that the pain of separation experienced by Rādhā and Govinda has nothing to do with this plane. And so, with this caution, we may talk to some extent about separation, but it will be extremely dangerous for us to discuss or to think of when Rādhā-Govinda and Their intimate friends are combined, enjoying each other’s company, because if we deal with the Pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa with any mundane conception, we will create a great offence. So to conceive of the union of Rādhā and Govinda is more dangerous than cultivating feelings of separation, as Mahāprabhu has shown by His example."},{"class":"b44","text":" In separation from Kṛṣṇa, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu is thinking, “I can’t tolerate even My own life without Kṛṣṇa! Without His grace, without His company, I can’t maintain My undesirable existence.” This kind of mood helps us, but still we should not imitate it; rather we must respectfully accept it as our highest ideal. This will help us brush aside our filthy, unwanted habits (anarthas). If some tears come, however, we should not think that we have realised the highest stage; that sort of thinking should be avoided. Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu Himself says, “I don’t have a drop of divine love within Me, for otherwise, how could I maintain My mundane life?”"},{"class":"b69","text":" And Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu took sannyās so that the residents of Nabadwīp would be drawn into this high stage of separation through affection’s force. His old mother Śachī Devī was crying hopelessly. His young wife, Viṣṇu Priyā Devī, was helplessly passing Her days. Mahāprabhu took sannyās to create excitement, piercing into the hearts of the people the divine love that He came to give. They thought, “Who was Nimāi Paṇḍit? What great benefit did He come to give us?” That He left everything made them sympathetic towards Him. And for all these reasons the Lord went to take sannyās."},{"class":"b70","text":" “I must run to Vṛndāvan!”"},{"class":"b51","text":" After the function of sannyās was finished, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu became mad. “I must run to Vṛndāvan”, He thought. “I have given up all connection with this world. I have no attraction to it. I must run to Vṛndāvan to exclusively engage Myself in the service of Kṛṣṇa.” In trance, He began to chant a verse from the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> where Kṛṣṇa gives a description of sannyās to Uddhava. This verse was spoken by a tridaṇḍi bhikṣu, a mendicant. Mahāprabhu quoted this verse, thinking, “I have accepted this garb of a sannyāsī for this is favourable to My spiritual life. Now, no one in society has any claim over Me, and I will be able to exclusively devote Myself to the service of Kṛṣṇa. I am going to Vṛndāvan with no other engagement or connection with anyone.” In this way, in ecstatic madness He began to chant and dance. Keśava Bhāratī Mahārāj embraced Him, and both Guru and disciple joined together, chanting and dancing. At that time Mahāprabhu spoke the verse of the brāhmaṇ who, in the last stages of his life, took tridaṇḍa-sannyās and had to tolerate the torture of society in different forms. He said:"},{"class":"b60","text":" etāṁ sa āsthāya parātma-niṣṭhām<br />adhyāsitāṁ pūrvatamair maharṣibhiḥ<br />ahaṁ tariṣyāmi duranta-pāraṁ<br />tamo mukundāṅghri-niṣevayaiva"},{"class":"b43","text":" “The previous great sages have accepted and shown the path of sannyās.

Crossing over this māyā, I shall reach Vṛndāvan and fully enter the service of Kṛṣṇa.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The dress of a sannyāsī is meant only for an external adjustment, but the real thing is to serve Mukunda. And so, with this verse, He suddenly started towards Vṛndāvan from Katwa. Near the banks of the Ganges, He entered the jungle thinking, “Now, my duty is to reach Vṛndāvan as soon as possible and there, in a solitary place, I shall sit and chant and sing the Name of Kṛṣṇa.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu ran towards Vṛndāvan and entered the jungle before evening.

In Viśrāma Talā, on the other side of the Ajay River, there is a place which is observed as the seat of Śrī Chaitanya.

Now You have taken Your bath in the western side, so You have taken Your bath in the Yamunā, according to scripture. So Nityānanda Prabhu has not told any lie. Anyway, I have come with this new dress for You. Leave Your wet clothes and accept this new garb. I have also cooked something for You. For three days You have been fasting, and today, as a sannyāsī, You must take some charity in My house. I am a poor man”, He said with folded palms, “but You must come.” They took Him by boat to Śāntipur, to the house of Advaita Āchārya.

It is a stage of consciousness. In different stages of consciousness, there are different subjective realities. Everything springs from the willpower of the Lord. He is the subject, and His potency and sweet will is all subjective. The Lord said, “Let there be light”—and there was light. He said, “Let there be water”—and there was water. He said, “Let there be earth”—and there was earth. If, like a hypnotist, the higher subject wants to make the lower subject see something, he cannot but see that thing. We are all in the subjective, imaginary world, but above imagination is the supersubjective plane of reality. So, Kṛṣṇa reveals Himself to one who has developed pure consciousness, and in the stage of pure consciousness one can perceive the true nature of subjective reality (<span class=\\"e3\\">sattvaṁ viśuddhaṁ Vasudeva-śabditam</span>)."},{"class":"b69","text":" To show us that Vṛndāvan is everywhere, Mahāprabhu was running here and there in ecstasy.

It is aprākṛta, supramundane."},{"class":"b44","text":" Knowledge has been classified under five headings. The lowest is knowledge acquired through one’s own sense experience: pratyakṣa—what we have experienced through our senses. That is the first stage. The next higher stage is knowledge we have not experienced with our own senses, but have gathered from the experience of others (parokṣa), just as the scientists have their experience, and we have gathered some knowledge from their inventions and discoveries."},{"class":"b69","text":" The third stage is above the stage of human experience (aparokṣa). It is something like deep sleep. When we awaken, we say, “I slept very happily; I slept a very good, sound sleep.” But when in deep, dreamless sleep, we have no consciousness of that state. When we return from a deep dreamless sleep, we express some awareness of that experience, but it is hazy. Aparokṣa is a sort of hazy experience which is indistinct, where the subject and material object come together, and the material object vanishes in the subject. Śaṅkar Āchārya, the great proponent of impersonalism, explains the gradation of consciousness up to this point."},{"class":"b70","text":" The fourth dimension"},{"class":"b44","text":" On the other hand, the great devotee-scholar Rāmānuja Āchārya, as well as other Vaiṣṇava Āchāryas, are of the opinion that there is a fourth stage beyond this. That plane is called adhokṣaja, transcendental, or that which exists beyond the scope of the senses, whether gross or subtle. It is a plane that we can experience only when, by its sweet will, it comes down to our gross plane of understanding. If it withdraws, we are helpless; we can’t find it. We cannot say that the Absolute Truth is under the control of our knowledge. We can’t measure it like that. It is independent. By its sweet will it may come down and we may experience that higher realm, but if it withdraws, we are quite helpless; we can do nothing. We may cry or we may pray, but we can’t enter there forcibly by dint of our own power. This is the fourth plane of consciousness, and it is grand, all-powerful, and awe-inspiring. Only if it reveals itself to us can we have some experience of that plane known as Vaikuṇṭha, the unlimited spiritual region of awe and power."},{"class":"b44","text":" That is the adhokṣaja plane. So, there is pratyakṣa, direct experience through sense perception, then parokṣa, learning through the experience of others, then aparokṣa, the negative plane of indistinct consciousness, and then the fourth dimension: adhokṣaja. We are underground. Real knowledge is above, on the surface, beyond our experience. If we can pierce through the thick coverings walling up our experience, we can come in connection with another plane of consciousness: that is adhokṣaja. <span class=\\"e3\\">Adhokṛtam indriyajaṁ jñānam</span>: adhokṣaja means the superior knowledge which can force down our knowledge of the experience of this world.

It is called aprākṛta. That is Goloka, the full-fledged theistic conception which is only found in Kṛṣṇa’s domain. Central knowledge of the Absolute must have a connection with even the lowest level of mundane creation; it must be able to harmonise the worst portion of the illusory world. This is known as aprākṛta, supramundane. To enter that highest realm is possible only through divine love."},{"class":"b69","text":" Everything can be compensated only through love. There is a saying that a loving mother thinks that her blind child has beautiful lotus eyes. She is blinded by affection. So, what is mean and low can only be compensated by love—that shines very beautifully. That is prema, or divine love. Through mercy, through pity, through grace, a king can come to play with a boy on the street. Affection can make it possible. The difference between high and low disappears at such a stage."},{"class":"b70","text":" The spiritual enchanting potency"},{"class":"b44","text":" The residents of Vṛndāvan think themselves ordinary. This is jñāna-śūnyā-bhakti, divine love which is free from any calculation and does not consider even the opulence and power of the Lord. That devotion is above even Vaikuṇṭha and goes on under the spell of yogamāyā, the spiritually enchanting potency. It is the special art of yogamāyā that those holding the highest position think themselves very insignificant. Love removes the difference of great and small, high and low. Vṛndāvan is such a plane of existence. There we find devotion free from any trace of calculation (jñāna-śūnyā-bhakti).

A king, when he is not very conscious of his power, thinks of himself as an ordinary person. It is something like that. Someone may be a great doctor but through affection he may do the work of a nurse for his patient. Out of his love and affection for the patient, he may come down to do such work, but still he is great. This is the beautiful nature of Vṛndāvan life. It is great without the attitude, the air of bigness. Although they are really great, they appear to be simple. Power dressed in affection and love, couched in humility—that is Vṛndāvan.

From an impartial judgement of the facts, their position is very great, but through humility they have apparently descended to our level. It is a very sweet and beautiful form of life that we find in Vṛndāvan. And Mahāprabhu came to show that to us through <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>. Kṛṣṇa is the Lord of that land, and the cows, hills, forests, and the Yamunā River are all creating a favourable environment there."},{"class":"b69","text":" So Mahāprabhu took sannyās to teach us, to take us up and make us the permanent inhabitants of that place. He says that actually, our real self lives in that plane, but unfortunately our consciousness has become focused outside. Now we are captured by the mundane aspect of this creation and think that we are suffering, but this is all illusion. We must get relief from this mania. Mania means madness, and now we are possessed by some mania.

At the bottom of all this is the fact that you have identified yourself with this material world and this body of flesh and blood. You have to retrace your path and go back to your home.” That is what is necessary. Our homeland is such a lovely and beautiful and divine place. Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s sannyās is all for us, and it is for the purpose of taking us back home, where we can have home comforts, home sweetness. If we have any home-consciousness within, then we must appreciate such a proposal: home sweet home."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s sannyās is apparently very cruel to His devotees, and to His family members, but it was meant only to take us to our home.

Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, the nineteenth-century founder of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, in his internal conception of the Pastimes of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, draws a parallel with the Pastimes of Kṛṣṇa in Kuruksetra. There Dvārakā Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs of Vṛndāvan were meeting, and the gopīs and gopas wanted to take Kṛṣṇa from Dvārakā back to Vṛndāvan. Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur expresses a similar aspiration. When Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu returned to Navadwīp and the crowds rushed to see Him, He stood on the roof of Vāchaspati Paṇḍit’s house in the red dress of a sannyāsī. Taking himself as a permanent resident of Navadwīp, and as one of the members of Śrīvās Aṅgam, Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur envisions himself seeing Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu on the rooftop. When Kṛṣṇa had gone to Dvārakā and wouldn’t return to Vṛndāvan, the hearts of all the devotees were burdened with grief. In a similar way, Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur fervently prays: “When will the day come when Nimāi Paṇḍit will give up the robes of renunciation and again come and join us in kīrtan in the house of Śrīvās? Now He can’t come—as a sannyāsī He can’t return to His old house. So now, we are deserted by Him, but our aspiration this: just as the gopīs wanted Kṛṣṇa’s royal dress removed, and His cowherd dress resumed, so they could take Him again to Vṛndāvan and play with Him and rejoice, we aspire that Mahāprabhu’s sannyās dress be removed, and His former dress resumed. In this way, we will get back our Nimāi Paṇḍit, who is one of us, in Śrīvās Aṅgam. And together we shall rejoice, taking the Name of Kṛṣṇa.

It should be a spontaneous, unchecked, and natural flow. It should be exclusive, independent, and without reservation.

The first stage is that it cleanses the mirror of the mind. If the mirror of the mental system is covered with dust, we cannot see things clearly, and scriptural advice cannot be properly reflected there. What are the different kinds of dust covering the mirror of the mind? Our infinite, fleeting, and organised desires are considered dust, and our hearts and minds are covered with layers and layers of this dust. Therefore we cannot see things properly; they cannot properly reflect in our mind because it is covered with the infinite ordinary desires of this mundane world (<span class=\\"e3\\">bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kāmī—sakali ‘aśānta’</span>)."},{"class":"b44","text":" So the first effect of Śrī Kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtan is the cleansing of the mind. The Vedic social system (varnāśram-dharma) has been formed for this purpose. If we discharge our social duties perfectly, without any attraction for the consequences, we achieve purification of our consciousness—but the first installment of Nām-saṅkīrtan gives us the end result of varnāśram-dharma: purification of the heart and mind. Then we can understand Vedic advice properly."},{"class":"b44","text":" The next effect of chanting the Holy Name is that it extinguishes the fire of material existence in the forest of repeated birth and death. We are forced to come into creation and again die. The mundane wave catches the soul which mingles with that vibration in different stages. That is stopped by the second effect of Śrī Kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtan, and we become liberated."},{"class":"b69","text":" With the first stride, the intelligence is purified. With the second stride, the Holy Name effects liberation from the great conflagration of threefold miseries. The threefold miseries are ādhyātmik: miseries within the body and mind, such as disease and mental anxiety; ādhibhautik: miseries from our neighbours: man, beasts, insects, and so many other living beings; and ādhidaivik: natural catastrophes like famine, flood, and earthquake. We have to suffer from these three kinds of miseries which burn in our heart like fire. But everything is extinguished forever by the second stride of Nām-saṅkīrtan which gives us relief."},{"class":"b70","text":" The supreme goal of life"},{"class":"b43","text":" The next stage is <span class=\\"e3\\">śreyaḥ-kairava-chandrikā-vitaraṇam</span>: the Holy Name bestows upon us the supreme goal of life. After doing away with these two negative engagements, our positive engagement begins and ultimately takes us to reality, to the real truth, which is eternal, auspicious, and beautiful. It takes us to that auspiciousness which is above this world of difficulty, and in a general way we achieve the supreme goal, the highest auspiciousness, the greatest good from chanting the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa. If we analyse this scrutinisingly, we find that in this stage, the Holy Name takes us to an intimate personal relationship with Kṛṣṇa which includes neutrality, servitude, friendship, and filial affection (śānta, dāsya, sakhya, and vātsalya rasa). Śreyaḥ covers the grace of Nityānanda Prabhu, for it is by His grace that we may be allowed to worship Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvan (<span class=\\"e3\\">Nitāiyer karuṇā habe Vraje Rādhā Kṛṣṇa pābe</span>)."},{"class":"b44","text":" The next stage is <span class=\\"e3\\">vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam</span>.

When we come to the proper level while chanting the Name of Kṛṣṇa, we find the transcendental ocean that is above all sorts of experience. The Name comes to assert Himself over us according to the degree of our surrender, and when our surrender is complete, we feel a new type of ecstatic joy; we experience an infinite ocean of joy which is not static, but always dynamic. There we find new life and a new type of blissfulness. It never becomes stale or static, but at every moment gives us a taste of the infinite ocean of ecstasy."},{"class":"b70","text":" Complete self-purification"},{"class":"b43","text":" The last effect is that our entire existence is purified. This kind of enjoyment does not pollute—it purifies. Enjoyment means exploitation.

All enjoyment that comes from the centre, from the autocratic desire of Kṛṣṇa, purifies us completely."},{"class":"b44","text":" In this verse, the words <span class=\\"e3\\">sarvātma-snapanam</span> mean that all different phases of the self which may be conceived are fully satisfied and purified at once by chanting the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa.

Both the singer and the audience as well as anyone who comes in connection with the transcendental sound will be purified. <span class=\\"e3\\">Snapanam</span> means ‘purifying’. That vibration purifies everyone and everything that comes in touch with it."},{"class":"b44","text":" So Mahāprabhu says, “Go on with saṅkīrtan, the congregational chanting of the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa.” Of course, saṅkīrtan must be genuine, so association with saints is necessary. It is not an empirical attempt. We are attempting to have a connection with the higher, unconditioned realm which can descend to help us here. We must have that connection with higher reality, for that is all-important. The Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa is not mere physical sound; it is not lip-deep only, but it has a greater and higher aspect (<span class=\\"e3\\">Nāmākṣara bāhirāya baṭe tabu Nāma kabhu naya</span>). It is all spiritual. We are in the marginal plane of existence, so some higher connection is necessary in order that the wave will descend from that higher realm and come to us and spread its influence outside as well."},{"class":"b69","text":" Wherever it goes, the saṅkīrtan of the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa will produce these sevenfold results. This is the purport of Mahāprabhu’s first verse. The first effect is that the Holy Name cleanses the soul which is attacked by the dirt of desires from the mundane world. By the second effect it gives mukti, liberation, perfect independence from material forces. The third effect brings real fortune: the opening of the soul’s treasure. The innate resources of the soul are gradually awakened by the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa. Here, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu includes the other forms of relationship with the Personal Absolute. In describing the next step, He takes the mood of conjugal devotion, where one is absolutely disposed for Kṛṣṇa’s enjoyment, unconditionally surrendering everything for His maximum pleasure."},{"class":"b70","text":" “I need millions of mouths!”"},{"class":"b50","text":" The next effect is the tasting of His ecstatic association.

I want millions and millions of ears to hear the sweet Name of Kṛṣṇa.” This is the temperament of a devotee when his attention is drawn towards the Holy Name. Then he faints; he loses himself, merging in an ocean of ecstasy and joy. And in great disappointment he says, “I failed to understand the quality and quantity of the substance of Kṛṣṇa’s Name.

A blade of grass can be blown here and there by a storm, or by the external environment, but I will always be reluctant to go in a particular direction.

Why has the example of a tree been given? It has been analysed in this way: if no one pours any water on a tree, it does not protest, “Oh! Give me water!” If anyone comes to disturb the tree, snatching its leaves, cutting its branches, or even chopping it down, a tree remains silent; it gives no opposition. We should try to see how insult, poverty, punishment, or other unfavourable dealings are necessary to purify us, and with minimal punishment we shall be released from material existence."},{"class":"b69","text":" Through Kṛṣṇa consciousness we have connected with the highest object of life, the highest fulfilment of life—what price are we ready to pay for that?

In philosophical calculation, of course, without God’s will nothing can happen. But in a concrete way, a devotee sees, “O Kṛṣṇa! You are backing these children, You are disturbing me, and I shall teach You a lesson. I know how to deal with You. I shall complain to Mother Yaśodā, and she will chastise You.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The advanced devotees are established in the consciousness that Kṛṣṇa is behind everything, and they take everything in that way.

As our Guru Mahārāj said, “Had I been in the role of a bābājī, a non-assertive, reclusive saint, I would have walked away from the place without offering any opposition. But when we are preaching and have taken the responsibility of leading so many souls to the domain of the Lord, our adjustment must be made accordingly.” Generally, we may be indifferent to those who are personally inimical to us, but when we preach on behalf of the Lord in an organised way, our duty changes: we cannot be indifferent to antagonists."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is mentioned in the scriptures by Jīva Goswāmī that according to one’s own particular status, these things should be taken into consideration and the necessary things should be done.

That is not the duty for ordinary persons; if they act in such a way, there will be a riot. We should not be eager to inflict physical punishment upon anyone."},{"class":"b44","text":" Hanumān is a Vaiṣṇava, but he is seen to destroy so many lives. The same is true of Arjuna and so many other devotees. Even Kṛṣṇa and Rāmachandra are also seen to kill so many demons in war.

When there is an insult to the Guru or the Vaiṣṇavas, a devotee will oppose the blasphemers according to his might."},{"class":"b44","text":" Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, in one of his songs, says that we should not only tolerate the evil-doings of others and a disturbing environment, but we should do good to those by whom we are being tortured. The example is given of a tree. One who is cutting the tree gets shade and comfort from the tree even while cutting it down. In conclusion, he says that humility, mercy, respect for others, and renunciation of name and fame, are the four qualifications for chanting the Holy Name of Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" We are the meanest of the mean. We should always be conscious that we are beggars. We should think, “Although I am a beggar, I’ve come to beg for the highest thing; let no disturbance dissuade me from my attempt.” At the same time, our attitude toward the environment should be respectful."},{"class":"b52","text":" In this way, by becoming educated in the Kṛṣṇa conception of divinity, everyone should be given respect according to his position. It is the guiding instruction in the worship of the Holy Name (Nām-bhajan) that we must take the position of the slave of the slave of the slave of the Lord. If you want to chant the Name of Kṛṣṇa, then don’t waste your energy with the trifling things of this world. Don’t allow your attention to be disturbed by tiny acquisitions like prestige or gain which is relative to money or physical comfort. Remember, you are trying for the greatest thing, and all other things are very small in comparison to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So, don’t waste your energy and valuable time. Be economical.

In the same way, after a long separation, Kṛṣṇa is there in Kurukṣetra, so the hankering for union felt by His devotees must come to its greatest point, but because He is in the role of a king, they cannot meet intimately. The circumstances do not allow the Vṛndāvan-līlā to take place. So at that time, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī needs the highest service from Her group, the sakhīs."},{"class":"b69","text":" Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur says that in that situation, a drop of service will draw the greatest amount of prema, divine love. In the Pastimes of Rādhā-Govinda, there are two aspects: sambhoga, divine union, and vipralambha, divine separation. When Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are very near to each other, but can’t meet intimately, service at that time can draw the greatest gain for the servitors. Therefore, Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur says, “I shall construct a hut on the banks of Rāma Hrad in Kurukṣetra and contemplate rendering service to the Divine Couple. If I can achieve that standard where the prospect of service is so high, then there is no possibility of returning to this mundane plane at any time.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" The fifth note"},{"class":"b50","text":" Upon arriving in Kurukṣetra, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī said:"},{"class":"b59","text":" priyaḥ so ’yaṁ kṛṣṇaḥ saha-chari kuru-kṣetra-militas<br />tathāhaṁ sā rādhā tad idam ubhayoḥ saṅgama-sukham<br />tathāpy antaḥ-khelan-madhura-muralī-pañchama-juṣe<br />mano me kālindī-pulina-vipināya spṛhayati"},{"class":"b54","text":" (<span class=\\"e3\\">Padyāvalī</span>)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “O My dear friend, now I am at last reunited with My most beloved Kṛṣṇa in Kurukṣetra.

And Vṛndāvan means the favourable paraphernalia. In this way, Vṛndāvan is unique."},{"class":"b51","text":" When Kṛṣṇa met the inhabitants of Vṛndāvan in Kurukṣetra, He first came to Nanda and Yaśodā’s camp after their long separation, to show parental respect to them. In the midst of their great disappointment, they felt, “Oh, our boy has come to see us at last.” It was as if life had returned to the dead. After some courtesy was shown to them, Kṛṣṇa made arrangements to meet privately with the gopīs, and suddenly He appeared in their camp. Externally, Kṛṣṇa was the leader of so many kings in India. And the gopīs had come from some unknown quarter, where they lived in the jungle in the society of milkmen. Externally, they had no position, and Kṛṣṇa held the highest position in the political and royal society. He was the central figure, like the eyeball in every eye. And they were in a helpless, poor and neglected condition. The gopīs pleaded with Kṛṣṇa, saying:"},{"class":"b60","text":" āhuś cha te nalina-nābha padāravindaṁ<br />yogeśvarair hṛdi vichintyam agādha-bodhaiḥ<br />saṁsāra-kūpa-patitottaraṇāvalambaṁ<br />gehaṁ juṣām api manasy udiyāt sadā naḥ"},{"class":"b71","text":" The group of gopīs told Kṛṣṇa, “O You who have a lotus navel, we know that the great master yogīs who have nothing to do with this mundane world try to meditate upon Your holy lotus feet. Their interest is in higher realisation in the conscious world. They are said to centre their highest attention on Your lotus feet. And those who are busy elevating their life in this world of exploitation are also busy worshipping Your lotus feet to escape the entanglement of action and reaction. The centre of interest for the elevationists (karmīs) and the salvationists (jñānīs and yogīs) is Your lotus feet."},{"class":"b70","text":" Kṛṣṇa country"},{"class":"b43","text":" “And what are we? We are simple people from the country with cows as our wealth. We are animal traders who live in the country, trade in the cow business, and sell curd and milk on the outskirts of society. We are neither scientific exploiters, nor are we the kind of exploiters who do research in the world of consciousness. We only know family life. We have no other qualifications. We are busy with our family life in the lower section of society. But in our audacity, we pray that if at any time You would kindly condescend to extend Your lotus feet to our negligible hearts, we would think ourselves blessed. We are busy in our family matters. We do not know scriptural life or the methods of the salvationists. We know nothing of yoga, jñān, Vedānta, or the Vedas. Our ultimate concern is neither with scriptures or moral standards. We hold a negligible position in society and simply pray that in the midst of our family life we may remember Your holy lotus feet. Please grant this to us. We can’t expect anything more from You.” That was their petition."},{"class":"b51","text":" Kṛṣṇa replied to them, saying:"},{"class":"b60","text":" mayi bhaktir hi bhūtānām amṛtatvāya kalpate<br />diṣṭyā yad āsīn mat-sneho bhavatīnāṁ mad-āpanaḥ"},{"class":"b43","text":" “Yes, I know.

For these reasons they want My service, but fortunately for you, you have some natural affection towards Me. That will ultimately bring you to Me.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" That is the formal or superficial meaning of what was spoken by Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs. But the great preceptors of our line have squeezed out another meaning from these prayers. They are conscious of the real, private relationship between the two parties, so they have drawn out another meaning based on the divine sentiment between the lover and beloved."},{"class":"b44","text":" When the gopīs prayed to Śrī Kṛṣṇa at Kurukṣetra, their real meaning was this: “Oh, we remember that one day You sent Uddhava to console us. He recited many scriptural references about how the whole world is mortal, how it is nothing, how we shall all have to die—affection has no great value; attachment must be cut out. He said that we must try to liberate ourselves from any attraction to the environment and attain salvation. You wanted to tell all these apparently sweet things to us through Uddhava."},{"class":"b44","text":" “Now, You Yourself are also showing us the same path. You say that You are great and that everyone should try, for their highest interest, to think of You.” This explanation is found in <span class=\\"e3\\">Chaitanya-charitāmṛta</span>. The gopīs tell Kṛṣṇa, “Do You think we are yogīs who will be satisfied with abstract meditation on You? Can we be satisfied by imagination? We are not a party to that. Neither are we karmīs, fruitive workers who are incurring a great debt from nature, who come to Your door to get relief, praying, ‘O God, please relieve us from all our previous sins.’ We do not belong to either of these two sections."},{"class":"b69","text":" “What are we? We want to live with You as Your family. We are interested neither in abstract thinking, nor in using You to clear off the faults of karma to nullify our sinful activities. We don’t want to use You for any other purpose. We want to have a direct family life with You. Don’t You know that? And still You send messages through Uddhava, and now this! Aren’t You ashamed of Yourself?” This is their inner meaning."},{"class":"b70","text":" Kṛṣṇa’s inner answer"},{"class":"b43","text":" Kṛṣṇa’s answer also has an inner aspect. He replies, “You know, everyone wants Me. Through devotion they want Me to help them attain the highest position in the world of eternal benefit. If they have a connection with Me, they consider themselves fortunate. But on the other hand, I consider Myself fortunate because I have come in touch with the valuable affection that I found in your hearts.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The gopīs read the inner meaning in that way. And when Rādhārāṇī could see into the inner meaning of Kṛṣṇa’s reply, She became satisfied. “Wherever He may be in the physical sense”, She thought, “At heart, He is mine alone.” She composed Her troubles within and returned to Vṛndāvan thinking, “He cannot but come to join our party again very soon.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" In <span class=\\"e3\\">Padyāvalī</span>, Śrīla Rupa Goswāmī reveals the inner meaning of this verse. When Kṛṣṇa came to the camp of gopīs in Kurukṣetra, He suddenly found Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and stooped down as if to touch Her feet. Rādhārāṇī began backing away, saying, “What are You doing! You are trying to touch My feet?” She shuddered, “You have done nothing wrong. You are My Master. You are at liberty to do whatever You want. I am Your maidservant and should try with every nerve to satisfy You. You have committed no crime. I am the criminal. How? I still drag on My body and life. This is My crime—I could not die from Your separation! Still, I show My face to the public—I am not worth Your divine affection. The whole burden of breaking the law of love is on My head.”"},{"class":"b70","text":" Not a bit of divine love"},{"class":"b50","text":" In this way Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī spoke. And in a similar verse, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu says:"},{"class":"b60","text":" na prema-gandho ’sti darāpi me harau<br />krandāmi saubhāgya-bharaṁ prakāśitum<br />vaṁśi-vilāsy-ānana-lokanaṁ vinā<br />vibharmi yat prāṇa-pataṅgakān vṛthā"},{"class":"b43","text":" “I have not even a bit of divine love for Kṛṣṇa within Me. Not even a scent of love for Kṛṣṇa is to be traced within Me. You may ask, ‘Then why are You shedding tears profusely, uninterruptedly? Day and night, You are always shedding tears for Kṛṣṇa. How do You explain this?’ Oh, you don’t know. I only do this to make a show and deceive the people in general into thinking that I have divine love for Kṛṣṇa. In this way I want to become famous as a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa. But I am a hypocrite. Why do I say so? The positive proof is this: I still live. I could not die! If I had any real love for Kṛṣṇa, I would have died from His separation. That is the positive proof that I have no trace of Kṛṣṇa-prema within Me.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" Kṛṣṇa-prema is so high and attractive that once coming in contact with it, no one can maintain his life without it. It is so high, so beautiful, so enchanting—it is heart-swallowing! It is impossible even to conceive of it. Divine love of such a high degree is known as prema. That divine love for Kṛṣṇa is not to be traced in this mundane world. If by chance someone had any experience of that high and vital kind of devotion, then by any separation from that, he would die instantly. It is so beautiful and magnanimous. We are out to search only for that divine love in this world. And Śrīman Mahāprabhu came to distribute that to the world for our sake."},{"class":"b70","text":" “Let us take poison …”"},{"class":"b43","text":" I have heard that a group of people in South America committed collective suicide because they felt that their faithful way of life was going to be destroyed by the present civilisation. They could not tolerate that, but rather, they thought, “Let us take poison and leave this world behind. Then we can live safely in the world of our faith. We have no charm for anything in this mundane world. Let us go with peace. We are members of the peaceful world. Let us enjoy that peace which is independent of material acquisition.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" We can agree that there is no charm here that shall make us hesitate to withdraw from this world, but we must also disagree and say that our life in this world is valuable. Why? With this life we can acquire a higher aspiration. We can have the chance of acquiring the goal from this plane. This human life is so valuable that with it we can take the path of the highest divine conception. This human body is highly valued and rarely achieved. In <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> (11.9.29) it is stated:"},{"class":"b60","text":" labdhvā sudurlabham idaṁ bahu-sambhavānte<br />mānuṣyam artha-dam anityam apīha dhīraḥ<br />tūrṇaṁ yateta na pated anumṛtyu yāvan<br />niḥśreyasāya viṣayaḥ khalu sarvataḥ syāt"},{"class":"b43","text":" “The human form of life is very rarely attained, and although temporary, gives us a chance to achieve the supreme goal of life. Therefore, those who are grave and intelligent should immediately strive for perfection before another death occurs. There are so many forms of life: the aquatics, the vegetable kingdom, the animals, the birds, ghosts and other living beings, but only in this human position do we hold the key to the complete solution of the problems of life.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" If we can use this human life in a valuable way, we can acquire the key by which we can become free from the whole chain of life in this troublesome world. We can get rid of the bondage of all sorts of physical and mental troubles. The key is here, in this human form of life. Jīva Goswāmī says that lower life-forms have insufficient understanding to realise the highest truth. And in the higher life-forms, such as demigods, because previously acquired energy or karma has accumulated on all sides, the chief enjoying elements are surrounding the living being. It is difficult to escape the charm of those influences and begin the prospect of a fresh life in a higher plain of consciousness. This human form of life is the most advantageous position to escape this entanglement and reach the highest object of our divine life."},{"class":"b70","text":" The highest conception of magnaminity"},{"class":"b43","text":" Sometimes people ask, “Why did Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu choose to give the highest conception of divine love—Kṛṣṇa-prema—to the lowest class of people, to the people of Kali-yuga?” But that is the very nature of Śrī Chaitanya-avatār. Why did the gopīs who are considered to be the most exalted devotees come from a neglected social position? What is the meaning of the highest conception of magnanimity? What should be its nature? To help the most needy."},{"class":"b69","text":" And because Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu comes from the highest position, He cannot give ordinary things, and His attention must be drawn to the most needy. Is it unnatural? The highest magnanimity must take notice of the lowest and most needy. And if He wants to help them, He will do so with His own coin. He cannot distribute to them only glass or stone chips. When He has the opulence of jewels and gems, why should He search for stone chips to distribute to the lowest level? He must extend to the lowest and poorest people what He thinks to be real wealth."},{"class":"b70","text":" Mahāprabhu—the great messiah"},{"class":"b43","text":" So we should all fall at the feet of the great messiah, Śrī Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu. His devotees say, “If we had to conceive of a place where Gaurāṅga had not appeared, we could not maintain our lives. We shudder to think of living without such a magnanimous friend as Śrī Gaurāṅga.” How could one live his life without Gaurāṅga? It is impossible. The world is not worth living in without Gaurāṅga."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrī Gaurāṅga is most magnanimous. Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu and His associates the Pañcha Tattva have come to raise all souls from their fallen condition. Generally, only deserving persons can gain entrance into Vṛndāvan, into Kṛṣṇa-līlā. But as Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, Kṛṣṇa Himself has come down to cure the offenders of their offences and grant them entrance into Vṛndāvan. Simply by chanting the names of the Pañcha Tattva and by remembering Their līlā, we can be purified even from the lowest position and prepare for participation in Vṛndāvan-līlā."},{"class":"b69","text":" In Goloka Vṛndāvan, Rādhā-Govinda are enjoying Their Pastimes of divine love within Their own circle. And there is another quarter, where Rādhā-Govinda are combined as Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu—Kṛṣṇa Himself in the mood of Rādhārāṇī is tasting His own sweetness with His entourage. We have to realise this through the recommended process. Who is Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu? He came here to bestow upon us the gift that will promote us to the highest goal of life."},{"class":"b70","text":" Gaura consciousness"},{"class":"b43","text":" To bring Śrī Gaurāṅga nearer to our soul is to get, even unconsciously, a guarantee of our achievement in Kṛṣṇa-līlā. For the fallen souls it is more useful to cultivate devotion to Śrī Gaurāṅga. That will give us the complete fulfilment of life with the least trouble. Devotion to Gaurāṅga will not lead us to any haphazard or misconceived Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but real Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We can have full Kṛṣṇa consciousness—plus something more. What is that?

That fountain is Chaitanya-līlā.” Although Chaitanya-līlā appears later than Kṛṣṇa-līlā, Chaitanya-līlā is the source, the foundation. We see that Kṛṣṇa appeared in Dvāpar-yuga, in the previous age, and then Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu appeared later, in Kali-yuga. Still, Their līlā is eternal. First there is the giver, then the gift.

Devotees, like clouds, take nectar from that lake, and distribute that nectar freely to the fortunate souls. Come and live in that lake. Ask the swan of your mind to take shelter in that lake.
