I humbly pay my respects to you all because you have given me this opportunity to speak about my Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His associates. I want to do good for you, good for myself, and good for the world. I have some experience. I am an old man, and I stayed many years with my Guru Mahārāj, who was vastly learned in Vedic knowledge and ultimately a siddha-mahāpuruṣ—a perfect, liberated soul. His affection, mercy, well wishes, and desire have given me something. I feel it, and I cannot deny it. I may be a very low-class person, but how can I deny the gift of my Gurudev? I am a very tiny and insignificant jīva-soul, nothing else; this is my identity. But if I give all of you the gift of my Lord Kṛṣṇa and my Guru Mahārāj—the little ecstasy that I have got—if I give to your holy ear the sound vibration that is coming down from the transcendental world, you must be benefitted, and I shall also be benefitted. Kṛṣṇa will bless me, and my Guru Mahārāj will be satisfied that I shall have done something in this world."},{"class":"b44","text":" Actually we are all spiritual entities, and because we are part and parcel of our Lord, our home is eternally existing in the transcendental abode of the Lord. You have heard of the Upaniṣads, Vedas, Vedānta, and the other scriptures which were revealed in India in written form five thousand years ago. Previously, this knowledge existed as śruti-mantram, spoken words, and it was transmitted by ṛṣis and munis to their disciples through śruti-mantram. At that time there were no books. Vedavyās has very mercifully given us the written form of śruti-mantram: the Veda. He divided the Veda (śruti) into four parts: <span class=\\"e3\\">Ṛg</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Sama</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Yajur</span>, and <span class=\\"e3\\">Atharva</span>. He also composed the corollary literatures (smṛti) like the <span class=\\"e3\\">Mahābhārata, </span>which is called the fifth Veda. The gist of the Vedas can also be found in the hundreds of Upaniṣads he wrote. The great ṛṣis, Vedic research scholars, have also presented the Vedic knowledge in the Purāṇas. Thus, through the great ṛṣis, this transcendental knowledge is being revealed in this mundane world, and when necessary, from time to time, an incarnation of the Lord manifests by whose divine mercy we get a connection with that transcendental knowledge."},{"class":"b44","text":" These Vedic literatures mainly try to give us transcendental knowledge, and for our benefit they have proclaimed, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Śṛṇvantu viśve amṛtasya putrā</span>: you are all the sons of nectar, transcendental nectar; you are from the nectarean ocean. Dive deep into that nectar!” We are all parts and parcels of the Lord, therefore we are spiritual relatives."},{"class":"b44","text":" Here in the mundane world we are seeing many differences. Some of us are born in India, some in Russia, some in Mexico, Latin America, and so on. In this world there are so many countries and so many completely different languages. But the spirit that is living within everybody, without which the body is useless, is coming from the same place. We call this place the spiritual world or the transcendental world."},{"class":"b44","text":" We want eternity, we want love, we want affection, we want mercy and ecstasy. These are our hankerings, but this mundane world cannot successfully give any of these things to us. But in the transcendental world everything is existing eternally in a very beautiful and sweet way."},{"class":"b44","text":" Everyone will pass away from this world one day, whether he is poor or rich, rogue or scholar, animal or tree. When we have been born, it is sure we will die. Death will not give any notice to us, “Today is your dying day”, or “Today is your birth day”. Birth and death are actually beyond our control. Maybe we can extend some time or reduce some time, but when we have been born, we must die. This wave of birth and death is surrounding this world. It is surrounding not only our present planet but the whole universe. Beyond the orbit of this universe many universes also exist, and this wave of birth and death is rolling through all of them. This knowledge has been given to us by the Vedic research scholars, and now the scientists in this age are also saying the same thing."},{"class":"b44","text":" This world is always completely filled with quarrel. The wave of death and birth is always flowing through this world, and there are so many problems. You hear many things on the radio, the television, and in the newspapers, therefore you know how much violence is going on all over. Everywhere this bad situation will come to be, as it is written in the scriptures. It is the Age of Kali. <span class=\\"e3\\">Kali</span> means quarrel. We cannot avoid it. I may be a very good man, but without cause I may be attacked by violence. Many things happen, and many good men have been killed. So death and birth is beyond our control. I may be protected by so many bodyguards, like John Kennedy, like Martin Luther King Jr, like Indira Gandhi, like so many who were protected by many bodyguards but could not avoid death."},{"class":"b44","text":" We are also not secure or satisfied in this world. What do we want here? We want love, affection, charm, beauty, and ecstasy. Ultimately, we want eternity, but in this world it is not possible in any way to get it. Here, what is the form of love, what is the form of beauty, of affection? All are only a shadow or reflection of the transcendental world. As such, here we are playing only within the shadow. All that we are getting is in the form of shadow, and the substance is missing."},{"class":"b44","text":" We are eating rice powder mixed with water and thinking we are drinking milk. Actually, when we will get a proper taste of transcendental ecstasy and feel its transcendental form, we will feel that transcendental knowledge is within us, and that our Lord is within us. Then we will understand everything very clearly and easily. That connection is necessary for us."},{"class":"b52","text":" In which way may we get it? Our sincere searching tendency can give us that connection. We must want to search. If it is possible, why will we not proceed in that line? The research scholars of religion have made many contributions and made that knowledge available. If you come forward sincerely, you will get it. It is so easy to get if you have faith, chastity, and a little good fortune.

We can search in many ways, but finally we must go to the Powerful, otherwise success is not possible. And the ṛṣis have searched in that way, to find that power and the Powerful. Through mundane knowledge it is not possible to get it. When they understood this, they tried to get it from the higher level, and they searched for the way in which it would be possible to get it. That transcendental knowledge has been given in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad</span> <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.14) by Śrī Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b81","text":" दैबी ह्येषा गुणमयी मम माया दुरत्यया ।<br />मामेव ये प्रपद्यन्ते मायामेतां तरन्ति ते ॥"},{"class":"b60","text":" daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā duratyayā<br />mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te"},{"class":"b43","text":" “O My dear Arjuna, fortunately, if anyone will take shelter of Me, I will relieve him from the illusory environment.

With this human form one can understand and find the way to study the spiritual world and seek the essence of transcendental knowledge. Thus the value of this human body is supreme."},{"class":"b44","text":" The animals have brains; they have willing, feeling, and thinking, but not in an organised way. But in the human form, one who is not a madman has some organisational ability within his brain. Whoever feels, wills, and thinks is the spirit soul living within the body. When this spirit soul leaves the body, the body becomes useless, and within a few days it decomposes. Once that spirit soul has gone out of the body, it cannot enter into it again. That spirit’s sadness or happiness we cannot feel from here, but the research scholars, the ṛṣis, they can feel it through their subtle or mental awareness. They can understand the situation, and through their research they have given us this knowledge.

You will not want to come back; you will be extremely satisfied.” Those who are not satisfied in this material world are trying to get liberation through renunciation. We have many things, but we have no happiness. Maybe we have no family life, and even if we have family life there are so many difficulties. In this material world we cannot expect to find satisfaction or fulfilment; it is impossible. Then, we will try to search for the place where there is some possibility of eternity, where love, affection, ecstasy, and beauty are existing. If we try to understand this, we must go to the scriptures or the sādhu, who is the living scripture, whose experience, practising life, and knowledge will give some good nourishment to us."},{"class":"b44","text":" With the sādhu’s association we will try to search, but when the searching spirit will come to us, we must be on faithful ground. Faith is the main basis. There is no other way. We may be a person of any religious mood, but if we want to make progress in religion we must first be faithful. In Christianity the first condition is that you must be faithful to the teachings."},{"class":"b44","text":" I read on the dollar bill, “In God We Trust”. This is a very nice expression: to trust in God. You must first come into the faithful plane. You want eternity, you want a beautiful world, you want everything transcendental, but you will not give anything to God? Not anything for God? How will you get everything beautiful from such a hellish position? Where you are living now is a hellish situation, but God is so merciful, He is giving so much love to you. His loving search for the lost servant is our wealth, not the wealth of God. His loving search for His lost servant is our property. But I must keep my faith in my religion, otherwise how shall I get it? It is impossible. In all the religions the basis is faith."},{"class":"b44","text":" I cannot see the ṛṣis and munis. I have not seen my own birth. My mother told me, “He is your father”, so I believe, “Yes, he is my father”, and I believe the government will give me my father’s inheritance. Why? My mother said he is my father, and a father’s property goes to his son. This is the rule, and we all believe it. Only when it comes to believing in God are we very unfortunate.

This is the nature of the material world. We see everything, but if we will give a little time to understand what is what, easily we can understand it. There are various paths in front of us; many religious personalities and books are existing in front of us. They do not want anything from us. What does Lord Jesus want for us? He wants us to submit to our Lord. That is his only expectation of us. “You are all the sons of God; give your obeisance, give your faith, give your love, give everything to Him.” He has shown us how to deal with each other. It is very near to Vaiṣṇavism. Christianity is very near to what we are practising."},{"class":"b44","text":" I read Solomon’s Songs, and I was surprised by what I found there. I read the Bible also, but Solomon’s Songs are very attractive. They attracted me because in our Vaiṣṇava religion there are five kinds of relationship with the Lord and a similar idea is presented in Solomon’s Songs. This is not expressed so much in the Bible, but <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, the other Purāṇas, the Vedānta, the Upaniṣads—all the Vedic scriptures—declare that the Lord has a sach-chid-ānanda vigraha. He has an eternal, spiritual, cognisant form of ecstasy. His form is not like mine. My form is material. I cannot grasp what is material and what is spiritual, therefore real knowledge remains hidden from me. Many religions have manifested in this material world, but having seen our position, having seen how much we can conceive and how much we can digest, the religious teachers have preached accordingly."},{"class":"b52","text":" From five thousand years ago the research scholars told us that the Lord has form; He has a sach-chid-ānanda vigraha. He is the creator of all creation. He has a brain. He has a face. He has everything. His form is like our human form, but it is not human. He is Kṛṣṇa, He is always attracting our mind. We can join His eternal Pastimes. We can have a relationship with Kṛṣṇa as our friend rather than as our God. There are five kinds of relationships we can have with the Lord: śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya, and madhura. We can play with the Lord through our love.

The transcendental world has that type of character. There the feelings are not artificial in any way; all the feelings are natural, a natural flow is there.
