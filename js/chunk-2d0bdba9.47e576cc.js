There are five types of rasas or divine ecstasies. Every rasa is fully present in Kṛṣṇa. The servitors of Kṛṣṇa are all happy in His exclusive service. There are so many religious conceptions to be found in the world. Some favour śānta-rasa [peacefulness], others dāsya-rasa [servitude], or sakhya-rasa [friendship], or vātsalya-rasa [parenthood]. But madhura-rasa [divine consorthood] is found in the extreme only in the line of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" For example, Jesus Christ introduced himself as a son of God, and so he showed us the Fatherhood of Godhead, taking himself as the son. That is taken as the highest relationship, and the kingdom of God is taken as heaven. This was Jesus’ explanation to the general mass. We see that his conception and that of the Vaiṣṇavas is sometimes quite similar. Guru Mahārāj also showed appreciation for Christianity. But the highest goal is madhura-rasa, and that is possible only by worshipping Kṛṣṇa in various ways. That type of service is not explained anywhere in the general scriptures, such as the Bible and the Koran. It is given in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, the glories of which were sung by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. It was He who distributed in the world the rasa of mādhurya, divine sweetness. The good souls who are attracted by this sweetness cannot be attracted anywhere else except to the lotus feet of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, and they thus begin the worship of Lord Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" The domain of Kṛṣṇa is Goloka. We should know of two basic divine natures of the Lord: mādhurya and audārya. In mādhurya, the Lord enjoys His own divine loving sweetness with His eternal associates. But in His mood of audārya, He is always employing different ways to distribute divine ecstasy to the pure souls, the devotees."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the Koran, we hear of <span class=\\"e3\\">Khodā</span> and <span class=\\"e3\\">bāndā</span>. <span class=\\"e3\\">Khodā</span> means ‘God’ and <span class=\\"e3\\">bāndā</span> means ‘servant’. There also we find a relationship between God and the soul. And in the line of Christ, the supreme relationship is shown as father and son. We have seen in the Song of Solomon only a hazy mention of consorthood. Actually, all the religions of the world generally reach to Brahmaloka, or the nondifferentiative plane of the Absolute. Before Brahmaloka, the plane of Brahma, is the river called Virajā, but beyond Brahmaloka, is the divine plane of Vaikuṇṭha. Our devotional life starts in Vaikuṇṭhaloka. This is Vaiṣṇavism. Śaṅkar Āchārya’s conception of nirviśeṣ or nirākār—an impersonal or formless ‘God’—is only the plane of Brahma. But our Vaiṣṇava śāstras or scriptures say that He has divine form."},{"class":"b51","text":" Although we cannot perceive it, within the sun there are also many forms. If we observe a jungle from afar, we see only a mass. But when we enter a jungle, we can properly observe so many things—birds, beasts, trees, flowers, and other beings—all engaged in their mutual affairs within the jungle. Similarly, from a distance, people say, “God is this. God is that. He has no form.” They describe Him according to their vision. But if we exclusively try to know the form of God and the domain of God, we shall have to come to the conception of Vaikuṇṭhaloka. From there, five rasas progressively appear, culminating in Kṛṣṇaloka. Kṛṣṇaloka is the highest plane, as confirmed in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>:"},{"class":"b59","text":" ete chāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam<br />indrāri-vyākulaṁ lokaṁ mṛḍayanti yuge yuge"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad Bhāgavatam: 1.3.28)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “The descents of the Lord are either His plenary portions or portions of those portions.

This interpretation is given in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>. The Supreme Personality has everything. In Him, there are not only the five kinds of chief rasas or mukhya-rasas, there are also the indirect or gauṇa-rasas. Everything is in Him, and everything is auspicious in Him."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu came to distribute the ecstasy of our transcendental life. And after Mahāprabhu, many of His pure followers or associates, pārṣads, came into this world. In this way, we think ourselves most fortunate to have as our guardian Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj. We are trying to serve him to our best capacity in the company of the Vaiṣṇavas. That is our happiness. I am very happy when devotees from all over the world come here to Śrī Nabadwīp Dhām for transcendental life, leaving aside the mundane. We are trying to practise in the plane of sevā—divine service. That alone can give us the highest goal."},{"class":"b51","text":" In this mundane world, there are the methods of karma, jñān, and yoga, or works, knowledge, and meditation. But every method cannot take us to the Absolute, although every method is somehow connected with the line of bhakti, devotion. Otherwise, they have no substance or factual existence.

He must be the gainer, and with the blessings of Sādhu, Guru, and Vaiṣṇava, he must come to the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Service is life. Everybody is always doing something—thinking, feeling, and willing. It is the nature of the jīva-soul in this world to be always active. But if he functions properly, in the line of devotion, that is called sevā, and he becomes the greatest gainer. So, we are trying to maintain our spiritual life under the guidance of Guru and Vaiṣṇava.

In this way, our śraddhā or faith will guide us."},{"class":"b51","text":" Guru Mahārāj always directed his devotees to engage themselves twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord. In this way, you can ignore the mundane world, and you must reach your destination. Some may engage themselves in fasting for spiritual life. It is very commendable that they want spiritual life, but in spiritual advancement, we still need to maintain our mundane body.

Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would harmonise them by calling them both and asking each to praise the other: “Describe the good qualities of this devotee.” In this way, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj taught us how to praise Vaiṣṇavas without looking at their faults."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj used the expression, “You are not a drain inspector.” He would explain, “You are a searcher, a searcher of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

That is, we are exploiting and exploited within this plane, and so reaction is always coming to us. Once, just after the war of Kurukṣetra, a ṛṣi from near Kashmir named Utaṅka came before Kṛṣṇa with a view to curse Him: “You are the cause of the violence in Kurukṣetra. If You had wanted to, You could have easily controlled the situation and prevented it, but You did not.

It is nature, otherwise the universe would not function, and that is true not just of this universe, but all universes.

He is the authority, of that there is no doubt. From the mundane to the other world, to Kṛṣṇa’s Dhām, Gurudev is giving that visa. He is the Āśraya-vigraha, the Lord we accept as our shelter. We must try to chant and follow his instructions, and then no real problems will come into our lives. This is the way to make our fortune in life. First, we must be initiated into the supramental power of Hari-nām, the mahāmantra, and here we find there is no limit to how many rounds we can chant, but the minimum must be sixteen rounds. Guru Mahārāj was so merciful, he said if you are engaged busily with the service of Guru, Vaiṣṇava, and Kṛṣṇa, then that divine sevā must be fulfilled, but the mālā [japa beads] must not fast. Therefore, even in exceptional circumstances, you must chant four rounds minimum. Normally, sixteen rounds only takes about one and a half hours, so to chant sixteen rounds is not so much. Śrīla Haridās Ṭhākur would take three lakhs of Names every day, that is, 192 rounds, and only after completing that would he take prasādam. When Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur Prabhupād was living at the Yoga Pīṭh Mandir in Māyāpur, he would take one lakh (sixty-four rounds) every day, but as the service of the Lord and the Vaiṣṇavas becomes more and more, then naturally the chanting will become less and less."},{"class":"b44","text":" Service is our life. We must always try to serve. “I do not know who is Kṛṣṇa, who is Bhagavān. I do not know what is what, but Guru and Vaiṣṇava know, and they are always serving their Lord properly.” With this mentality, we can help ourselves. I can help myself by always serving the Vaiṣṇavas and my Gurudev. This is the proper channel."},{"class":"b44","text":" If somebody is giving some money to the Maṭh, they may think that they are helping this Maṭh, but actually they are helping their own self by their energy. Money comes through the exertion of energy. A man is trying to gain money, and in so many ways he may be giving his energy for the collection of money. When that money is given to the Maṭh, then that means that his energy is now coming to serve Guru and Vaiṣṇava."},{"class":"b44","text":" When I was living as a brahmachārī, Guru Mahārāj would send me out to do collection, but no matter how hard I tried, I would not gain very much money. Still, Guru Mahārāj would continue sending me: “Go door to door and beg for something. If they give one rupee or 100 rupees, that doesn’t matter, but you must go door to door.” I was very hesitant, and every morning I would be very unhappy to go begging, and so every day Guru Mahārāj would teach me, “You are not going to beg for yourself, you are going for Guru-sevā, for the service of your Guru, and when they give you something, they are not being kind to you, they are being kind to themselves. They are collecting money in so many ways, and if they give some of that to you, then their money will be used for Guru–Vaiṣṇava-sevā. That money comes to Gurudev, and he is offering that to the Lord, and those that gave, they are gaining spiritual benefit.” In this way, Guru Mahārāj would preach to me."},{"class":"b44","text":" I was sixteen or seventeen years old, and it was very difficult for me, but Guru Mahārāj was always pushing me, “Go for begging!” and I got two types of benefit from that. Sometimes, the people I met would ask me why I was not using my time for the mundane pursuits. Why had I left home? Why had I neglected my worldly duties? Why was I not with my mother and father? And so many other questions. I would have to give the answers to their questions, and in so doing I would clarify myself within. Then secondly, I am collecting some money for my Gurudev, and he is offering that to his Gurudev and Lord Kṛṣṇa, and in this way I am gaining my spiritual benefit."},{"class":"b52","text":" Having a human body means we must maintain it nicely, but for what purpose? For the service of Guru, Vaiṣṇava, and Kṛṣṇa—only for sevā. And if I can keep up this ideal, then no māyā can come and overpower me. Śrīla Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī, Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī, Śrīla Sanātan Goswāmī, Śrīla Svarūp Dāmodar Goswāmī, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur Prabhupād, our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj Prabhupād—all of them are preaching, and if I also try to preach to this world, then I shall be benefitted, and somebody who hears that must also be benefitted.

In my forty-two years with Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, I never once heard him give permission for that to us. I know many of the books you are speaking of very well, that is my position was somewhat different. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj is a paramahaṁsa Vaiṣṇava, and I was his personal servant up until about 1983, when I engaged some others for his personal service. At that time, my sevā responsibility increased in such a big way that I was unable to always serve Guru Mahārāj in person, still I was always looking after his health."},{"class":"b44","text":" From 1973, I was treating Śrīla Guru Mahārāj as his doctor. Guru Mahārāj was so ill that all the doctors had said that no medicine could work in his body, and they were sure that within a few days or a week at most he would leave his body. Of course, Guru Mahārāj’s body is a siddha body, but still all the most qualified doctors said that it was beyond their capacity to treat him. Then, one day, I was taking my bath, and I was crying, and I called to Lord Śiva, “O Lord Śiva, you have said that I am your son, and really I feel that I am. You are the master of all medicine, so please, my Lord, give me some medicine for my Guru Mahārāj.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" After my desperate prayer, I heard the name of a medicine, as if from the air. At first, I thought I had mistaken the sound of the water from the shower as the name of the medicine, so I prayed again: “Please let me hear that name again so that I may be sure.” And again the sound of that medicine came. I knew that medicine because at that time I was practising as a doctor of homeopathy to the people, but until now I had never treated Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. This was because firstly I was not always staying with Guru Mahārāj, and secondly I had never considered myself to be a very good doctor. I was able to give some help to the poor, but I felt that was as much as I could do."},{"class":"b44","text":" In any case, after hearing the name of the medicine from Lord Śiva, I felt very free in my mind, and I knew that Guru Mahārāj will not leave us now. In the meantime, Hari Charaṇ Prabhu called me on the telephone, “Śrīla Guru Mahārāj is sinking fast, he has no pulse, only a slight heartbeat, and no blood pressure.” I told him, as a matter of fact, “Prabhu, don’t worry. I have just now been given a medicine by Lord Śiva. Give it to Guru Mahārāj and he will be cured. I am coming right away.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" I took the last train from Calcutta, which was late, and arrived at the Maṭh at about 12 o’clock midnight, and when I arrived, I saw Guru Mahārāj sitting in his chair and taking prasādam with his own hand. I asked Guru Mahārāj, “What has happened? Hari Charaṇ Prabhu told me you were sinking.” Guru Mahārāj replied, “Yes, I was, but Hari Charaṇ Prabhu gave me the medicine that you told him, and now you can see.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then his pulse came back and blood pressure became normal, and Guru Mahārāj said, “From this day, you will be my doctor.” All of Guru Mahārāj’s doctors consented, but still I was thinking that Guru Mahārāj is so great that somebody will chastise me, “Why are you not calling the doctor? Why are you treating Guru Mahārāj?” I was a little afraid, and still I could not consider myself as a very good doctor. Then Guru Mahārāj said, “All the doctors have already said that no medicine can work for me, so now happily you can treat me.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" So, I became Guru Mahārāj’s doctor, and after that his main illness was a chronic headache. He had suffered from this headache from the age of seventeen, and from twenty-two it became very strong. When Guru Mahārāj was suffering with this headache, he could not eat anything. Only, he would take water and constantly be throwing up. Sometimes, this would last for three days, sometimes six days, and sometimes up to twelve days. So, I began researching, and finally I told Guru Mahārāj, “Mahārāj, now your headache must go. I can treat you, and forever it will be gone.” All the homeopathic doctors who had treated Guru Mahārāj had prescribed nux-vomica and administered it from thirty to ‘MM’ potency, but none had had the desired effect. As they had all prescribed this same medicine, I concluded that nux-vomica must be Guru Mahārāj’s constitutional medicine. I then went to an allopathic doctor and asked him what is the dosage of nux-vomica mother tincture in allopathy. It was eight drops maximum, so I decided to give Guru Mahārāj five drops. When the first signs of the headache came, I administered the five drops of the mother tincture and the headache was reduced to a standby position. I was confident that now this headache will go because previously no medicine could check it."},{"class":"b44","text":" The only other medicine that could give Guru Mahārāj relief from this condition was cafergot, a type of ergotamine. Ergotamine is a very serious drug, and through taking this, all of Guru Mahārāj’s health problems came, but it was the only relief possible before now. After about two or three hours again, the headache came, and so I gave Guru Mahārāj one-fourth dose of the ergotamine, and again after about another six hours the headache returned, and I gave the nux-vomica. In this way, alternating between the two, and then after twenty-four hours I stopped the ergotamine and continued with the nux-vomica along with Lord Śiva’s medicine, and two other homeopathic medicines I had selected. That headache was then completely gone forever, and so in this way I was the doctor of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Still, if I was not at the Maṭh, I left instruction that if the need arose, then the allopathic doctor should be called."},{"class":"b44","text":" Once, Guru Mahārāj was suffering from bronchitis, and so Hari Charaṇ Prabhu called the top doctor of Nabadwīp, the president of the district medical board. He came, and after seeing Guru Mahārāj, prescribed some medicine. Guru Mahārāj flatly told him, “No, I will not take your medicine. Govinda Mahārāj is my doctor, and only after he comes and says, will I take your medicine.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, the doctor was very angry and said, “Then why did you call me?” Guru Mahārāj said, “I did not call you, Hari Charaṇ called you.” So, the doctor asked Hari Charaṇ Prabhu, who explained, “I called you because Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj said I should.” The doctor replied, “Do not call me again. If Guru Mahārāj will not take my medicine, then why should I come?” And angrily the doctor left. When I arrived, I asked Guru Mahārāj what had happened, and he told me the events, so I went to see the doctor. When I reached there, the doctor was still angry, and he said, “Oh, Govinda Mahārāj, you have come. It is not necessary to come. I shall not go with you. I shall not see Guru Mahārāj as my patient.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" I told him, “You must continue to see Guru Mahārāj.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “Why should I come? He will not take my medicine.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “No!” I said, “He will not take your medicine, that is the truth. That is because you yourself have said that your medicine will not work on him. I am calling you because I am not a very good doctor, and you are the best doctor in all of Nabadwīp. If you will examine Guru Mahārāj and give your diagnosis and prescription, then immediately I can understand from your medicine what homeopathic medicine I should give instead of that. This is why I call you, and you have love for Guru Mahārāj, so you must come.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then the doctor was quiet and said, “Yes, if that is the cause, then I shall come.” Anyhow, this was the history. I could not always stay with Guru Mahārāj, and so I engaged some others for that. But before that, Guru Mahārāj had no other servant, and so we heard many things during our association. And not only that, it was the desire of Guru Mahārāj to tell something about the Pastimes of Kṛṣṇa, of Rādhārāṇī, and others, so we heard from him, but always he told us in a very cautious way. Never did he tell us to read <span class=\\"e3\\">Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi</span> or similar books, but some things he told us, and I know many ślokas from <span class=\\"e3\\">Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Vidagdha-mādhava</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Lalitā-mādhava</span>, and others. That is, Guru Mahārāj had me study kāvya [Sanskrit composition], and it is necessary to read these verses to understand the many varieties of Sanskrit metre, language, beauty, alaṅkāra, and other things. But I can say it is a special case, it is not for all. These books are no doubt the supreme books of our sampradāya, but they are not for all and everyone’s reading. If anyone will read these books, then they will become a prākṛta-sahajiyā, and what will be for them? We do not want that our brother and sister will become that, so we must be very serious about our practising life."},{"class":"b44","text":" You have left everything—your culture, your allegiance to country, your community, your habits—everything you have left to try and practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so you will have to be serious. And you also need the result. To only practise, that is not your life’s goal, you need the end result—Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and how will you get that result? It is necessary to first understand this. We are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, but we have not become perfect. Why? We must research this. Why is it not happening? Why is the feeling not coming inside? If it were merely a cheating matter, then it would be no problem. But it is not a cheating matter, it is proven in the scriptures of India— the Veda, Vedānta, Upaniṣad, Purāṇa—five thousand years of culture, and there are munis and ṛṣis who have all got the result. If you study the scriptures like <span class=\\"e3\\">Mahābhārata</span>, you will say that all the advices are very good, and you will see that so many have gained the result.

Why is this? It is necessary to know. We do not want to cheat anybody, we want to do something good for others, and if we cannot do anything good, then at least we will not do anything bad to others. So, we must be serious about our practising life, and that means we must follow the directives given by Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Before approaching the rasa-tattva, the serious, high Pastimes of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, we must prepare ourselves for that, otherwise that will not give us the perfect sentiment."},{"class":"b50","text":" In <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> (10.33.39), it is written:"},{"class":"b60","text":" vikrīḍitaṁ vraja-vadhūbhir idañ cha viṣṇoḥ<br />śraddhānvito ’nuśṛṇuyād atha varṇayed yaḥ<br />bhaktiṁ parāṁ bhagavati pratilabhya kāmaṁ<br />hṛd-rogam āśv apahinoty achireṇa dhīraḥ"},{"class":"b43","text":" “If you hear the Pastimes of Kṛṣṇa with the gopīs, especially the Rāsa-līlā—which have been revealed in this mundane world by the grace of Kṛṣṇa—if you hear with full faith from a bona fide Guru or Vaiṣṇava, and if you subsequently describe that to others, then you will get the topmost supreme devotion to Kṛṣṇa. The conjugal play of Kṛṣṇa with the gopīs in paramour love—which He tastes in a variety of ecstasies—if you hear that, then your heart disease of lust will be expelled forever.” So, why is it that when we contemplate that līlā, we are getting difficulty and we are going to a hellish position? This we must research carefully, and that knowledge has been given by Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur and especially by Śrīla Saraswatī Ṭhākur. <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> has declared that the lust will be driven out of the heart, and one’s consciousness will come to the level of Kṛṣṇa-prema; bodily consciousness will be forgotten and that will be overtaken by prema consciousness. One must get that position. So, why are we not getting it? Hari-nām is a transcendental vibration nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. We are chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra, but in which way shall we chant? The mahāmantra manifests Himself by appearing in your heart and dancing on your tongue, but if Hari-nām is transcendental, then I cannot chant with my mundane tongue. This is the truth: the mundane cannot play with the transcendental. Only when the mundane becomes itself transcendental can it come in touch with the transcendental Name. It is very clear, so, somehow or another, we must make ourselves transcendental."},{"class":"b44","text":" There is a very nice analogy of the moon. The moon is always in the sky, but sometimes it is obscured by the clouds. Sometimes we can see it, and sometimes we cannot. So, the position of Hari-nām is like that. Like the cloud, we are always coming and going, and, according to our standard of chanting, sometimes Hari-nām may reveal a glimpse and sometimes He will remain covered. Then, finally, He will reveal himself in our hearts. When we are getting some result, then we can say, “Yes, it is the truth.” But if we get nothing, then we will become hopeless and think, “Why should I spend my time for that?” But behind that we will have to see that the reason is because I cannot chant properly."},{"class":"b44","text":" We can see that in every religion there is the chanting of the Lord’s Name in one form or another, so they cannot all be wrong. So, we can understand that there is great benefit in chanting the Lord’s Name. There is no doubt.

The ancient ṛṣis and munis have discovered and proven this. A ṛṣi is he who can discover something in the field of Vedic religion, a ‘PhD’ of religion, and a muni is he who is successfully practising the Vedic religion."},{"class":"b44","text":" The ṛṣis and munis are all chanting the Lord’s Name. Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā, the demigods, and gods are all chanting the Lord’s Name. Then, inside of the chanting, like the nux-vomica, there is medicine for us. Kṛṣṇa-nām is a form of Kṛṣṇa, and if you chant the Holy Name of your Lord, then you must get the result. So, what is the process to chant properly?"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīman Mahaprabhu has given the threefold process: humility, tolerance, and honouring others. If we cannot chant properly, then in some way we are not following that process. It is our ego. We are getting some result, no doubt, otherwise we would give up chanting Hari-nām. Also, Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur has said that if we cannot avoid the Nām-āparādh, offence to the Name—and in all probability we will not be able to avoid—but if our intention is to try to avoid that, then we should pray to Hari-nām, “O Hari-nām, I cannot properly chant Your holy form, so please reveal Yourself within my heart and purify me.” And Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur has said, “Chanting, chanting, chanting, chanting—somehow, in any way, we need to get the attention of the Holy Name.” In this way, we must get the desired result. I can say it is so. Otherwise, if it were only cheating, then I would have left it long ago. My nature is like that. I do not want to cheat anybody. I cannot beg from anybody, and I cannot cheat others. But sincerely I say to you, that you will get that result if you chant in this way, following the process of Mahāprabhu, and carefully guarding against making any offence to the Vaiṣṇavas."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, we should pray to Śrī Hari-nām, “O my Lord, You are transcendental, and I am living within this mundane world. I am a jīva-soul, and so I am also transcendental by nature, but due to misuse of my finite independence, I am covered by illusion, covered by ego. Please be kind upon me. O Hari-nām, give me Your mercy and reveal Yourself within my heart.” This must be our mood of prayer."},{"class":"b44","text":" I heard from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj that when his godbrother Śrīmad Parvat Mahārāj was a young boy, he used to live in the house next door to Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur.

We should know our Guru as perfect, but who is a Vaiṣṇava, that we do not know, and to what extent one is a Vaiṣṇava, that we also do not know. Someone may be twenty-five per cent, another seventy per cent, and another may be one hundred per cent, or only five per cent, we do not know. But we should know that everybody has some good qualities whether they are a demon or a saint, but who is a Vaiṣṇava we do not know."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, we must give honour to all, be respectful to everyone, and be surrendered to the will of God, then the Vaiṣṇavas must be kind to us. That is the process given by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur. It may be hard to follow that, but if we really need the true result, then we must proceed only in this way. And proper adjustment will be constantly required. Suppose someone will kick my father in front of me. If I will tolerate that and be humble, then he may kill my father. My father is to be protected by me. I am his young son, and he is old and weak, therefore it is my duty to protect him. So, what is humility and what is tolerance, everything will need to be adjusted. And Śrīla Prabhupād Saraswatī Ṭhākur has given that adjustment. He says that to just make some show of being very humble, lower than a blade of grass, will not be sufficient. Of course, that is the fact, but some substance must be within your heart, and that must be the perfect substance. In every situation, you must have some realisation. Should someone abuse your Guru in your presence, then what will you do? If you think, “I am very humble, and I shall be tolerant of him”, then that is not real <span class=\\"e3\\">tṛṇād api sunīchena</span>. We find the proper response in the person of Śrīman Mahāprabhu, who preaches this philosophy. When Śrīdhar Swāmī, the original commentator of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, was insulted by Vallabha Āchārya, then Mahāprabhu said, “Oh, you do not give recognition to Śrīdhar Swāmī?

If the devotees make their obeisance to Nṛsiṁhadev, and He is happy with them, then He will remove all the obstacles to their devotional life. The service of Nṛsiṁhadev is in śānta-rasa, and although the Gauḍīya–Vaiṣṇavas are praying to other forms of the Lord, such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, and Vāman, their only prayer is, “Make me perfect for the worship of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.” This is the line of the Gauḍīya–Vaiṣṇavas. They are not exclusive worshippers of any other incarnations of Lord Kṛṣṇa. They exclusively worship Kṛṣṇa, and more explicitly, only that Kṛṣṇa who is worshipped by Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, who receives the service of Rādhārāṇī, and who has so much love for Rādhārāṇī.

What was the mood and conception of Guru Mahārāj, that I can convey that to you. When devotees wanted to go to Nṛsiṁha Pallī, Guru Mahārāj would say, “Why are you going to Nṛsiṁha Pallī? You pray to Nityānanda Prabhu, and He will give everything to you.” But our intelligence and mentality are always mixed with mundanity, so sometimes we may think that Nṛsiṁhadev can give us more help in our devotional life. It is true that Nṛsiṁhadev can give us much help, but the Gauḍīya–Vaiṣṇavas are not thinking in that way. They worship Nṛsiṁhadev and make their daṇḍavat praṇāms to Nṛsiṁhadev, but all their attention will be under the guidance of Rādhārāṇī for the service of Kṛṣṇa. This is the Gauḍīya–Vaiṣṇava line."},{"class":"b44","text":" We have heard from Guru Mahārāj that Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur would often chant on the roof of his house, and every morning at 4 o’clock a great wind would pass over his roof in the direction of Māyāpur. Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur expressed his understanding of this miraculous wind as being Śrī Nṛsiṁhadev every day going to see the ārati of Śrī Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu. So, although ordinarily it may be difficult to conceive, we can conclude that Nṛsiṁhadev is also very eager to see the worship of Śrīman Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" Your father may be a very big, rich, and famous man, and another’s father may also be a very big, rich, and famous man.

That is the mood of the Gauḍīya–Vaiṣṇavas. They do not care to know who is very big and who is very small, they only know their own Guru and their own path of life. In this way, they are proceeding under the guidance of Śrī Guru in the Rūpānuga line, worshipping Nityānanda Prabhu and Mahāprabhu, who is nondifferent from Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Their life’s goal is shown by Rūpa Goswāmī Prabhu, that under the guidance of Lalitā Devī we will give service to Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, and our supreme guardian is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

I am trained by Guru Mahārāj for exclusive devotion to Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, and I’ve not heard anything other than this conception from the first to the last time I heard from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. I have grown up with that conception, and I cannot compromise, but still I am compromising. Somewhat unhappily, I am compromising because I see that if I don’t compromise with others, then they may leave the sampradāya of Guru Mahārāj. But the mood of Guru Mahārāj was always exclusive devotion to the service of Rādhārāṇī under the guidance of Lalitā Devī. That is the mood of Guru Mahārāj, and he cannot tolerate anything without this. Before 1980, there were only a few devotees living in Guru Mahārāj’s Mission, and those devotees were also not so qualified but they were very affectionate and very attached to Guru Mahārāj’s lotus feet, and due to that attachment and affection, they were following his orders.

It was only then that our connection with Nṛsiṁhadev was there to some degree, but not before. Only once yearly we were going and giving some pūjā, with five hundred or perhaps a thousand devotees to Nṛsiṁha Pallī during parikramā. The intention was not to see any one particular place but rather the whole of Gaura Dhām."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Western devotees are coming from time to time, and all cannot come during the time of Nabadwīp Parikramā. When they come, they want to see something of the Dhām, and so sometimes we are sending devotees to Nṛsiṁha Pallī, and they are very interested when they hear that Nṛsiṁhadev will give very easily. But the truth is that it is not so easy to get a boon from Nṛsiṁhadev. It is very easy to get a boon from Lord Śiva. If you ask for anything from Lord Śiva, and offer some Ganges water and bael leaves, then he will happily give anything. His mood is like that. But Nṛsiṁha is more difficult to please. Still, He is very merciful to the devotees, and He will give us some help in our devotional life. But the śuddha bhaktas, the pure devotees, are not asking for anything from anybody. And if they do ask for anything, then they will ask Kṛṣṇa. Their only business is with Kṛṣṇa, and no one else. If you are indebted, you must be indebted to Kṛṣṇa. If you are earning, then you earn from Kṛṣṇa, and if you are gaining, you gain from Kṛṣṇa. Their only transaction is with Kṛṣṇa.

Adhikār means one’s position in devotion, and Vyāsadev wants to bring us all to the line of Kṛṣṇa-bhakti.

Mādhavendra Purī accepted as disciples two of those brāhmaṇs, and they continued the worship of Gopāl in a royal style as befitting the Lord."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī got a dream in which Gopāl told him to fetch Malayaja sandlewood and have it smeared on His body, to give Him relief from the burning heat. Mādhavendra Purī arranged for the Lord’s proper worship in his absence and went to Bengal. At Śāntipur he initiated Śrī Advaita Prabhu. Then he continued on to Remuṇā in the south, eight kilometres from Bāleśvara. There, he had the darśan of Gopīnāth."},{"class":"b44","text":" As before, he never asked anyone for food. But he wanted to know what was being offered to Gopīnāth. The brāhmaṇ there described to him all the offerings, and told him how in the evening they were offering Gopīnāth twelve pots of kṣīr or condensed milk. For a moment Mādhavendra Purī thought, “If I could get a little of that kṣīr and taste it, I could make the same thing to offer to Kṛṣṇa when I go back to Vṛndāvan.” But immediately he felt to revile himself as unchaste, only for the thought to taste that kṣīr. He left, and went to the village market, and sat under a tree there, chanting the Holy Name of the Lord."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the meantime, the pūjārī made the offering (bhoga) to Gopīnāth as usual. He or the other brāhmaṇs there didn’t particularly think anything about Mādhavendra Purī. After the offering they all took the prasādam. After going to sleep, the head pūjārī got a dream in which Gopīnāth told him, “O pūjārī, you don’t know it, but I have stolen a pot of kṣīr for Mādhavendra Purī and hidden it under My cloth. He is My best devotee, he has come here, and now he is staying in a marketplace. He is fasting; go and give this kṣīr prasādam to him. You thought that you took twelve pots back out from the offering, but it is not so. By My illusion you took only eleven pots, and one pot is still underneath My cloth. Take that, and give it to Mādhava Purī.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" That pūjārī was astonished. Anyway, he went and opened the door, and found the pot of kṣīr under the cloth of Gopīnāth. A beautiful fragrance emanated from that kṣīr prasādam. He immediately took it and went from one marketplace to another, calling loudly:"},{"class":"b59","text":" kṣīra laha ei, yāra nāma ‘mādhava-purī’<br />toma lāgi’ gopīnātha kṣīra kaila churi"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Chaitanya-charitāmṛta: Madhya-līlā, 4.133)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “Oh! Mādhava Purī! Where are you? Take this kṣīr; Gopīnāth has stolen it for you. He knows you are hungry, and He has stolen this kṣīr just for you. Where is the person called Mādhava Purī?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Mādhavendra Purī was surprised and finally admitted his identity, “I am here”. And that pūjārī glorified him profusely and said, “Gopīnāth Himself stole this kṣīr for you. So take it.” Mādhavendra Purī took that kṣīr. He was so intoxicated with divine love; he ate that kṣīr prasādam with great ecstasy and kept the remains of the clay pot, tying it in a knot of his cloth."},{"class":"b44","text":" But he thought that tomorrow this news would spread to all corners and everyone would consider him a great soul. So, he fled Remuṇā out of the fear of fame, and went to Jagannāth Purī. But when he arrived at Purī Dhām, he found that everyone knew who he was, and how Gopīnāth had stolen the kṣīr for him. The news had already reached Purī before him. So, he could not conceal himself from anyone."},{"class":"b44","text":" As Kṛṣṇadās Kavirāj mentioned in his <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Chaitanya-charitāmṛta</span>, “It’s well known in the world that name and fame runs after those who are indifferent to it.” This is the nature of fame, and such was the case with Mādhavendra Purī. When he was recognised by everyone, he also thought of the positive side of it—he would be helped in collecting that sandlewood for Gopāl. The King’s ministers and entourage, and so many servitors of Śrī Jagannāthdev, came to see Mādhavendra Purī, and he told them about his necessity. There would have been many dangerous obstacles from the mlechchhas on the way from Odisha to the place where sandlewood was available, but by the King’s influence he gained much help. The King also owned much jungle area containing sandlewood. He was given two men to help him carry that sandlewood, and they set out for Vṛndāvan. Remuṇā is on the way to Vṛndāvan, so they stopped there. Again, everyone recognised Mādhavendra Purī, and he was received with great honour and reverence. The servitors of Gopīnāth gave him much kṣīr prasādam and other kinds of prasādam."},{"class":"b44","text":" That night, again a dream came to him, in which Gopāl told him, “Myself and Gopīnāth are nondifferent; it’s not necessary for you to bring this sandlewood all the way to Vṛndāvan. Offer it to Gopīnāth and give full worship and regard to Him with this sandlewood, and I shall receive it in that way.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Mādhavendra Purī was astonished, thinking, “How merciful Gopāl is to me! He has again instructed me.” Then he engaged two more men to grind the sandlewood, and it was offered all over Gopīnāth’s whole body for the entire summer season."},{"class":"b44","text":" Every day, Mādhavendra Purī joined the ārati of Gopīnāth, and by the Lord’s will, thousands of people visited, and grand festivals were conducted by the grace of Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī. Gopāl was happy with his service. Gopāl had told him, “It’s not necessary for you to return to Vṛndāvan, but you will see Me here in Remuṇā and thus attain everything.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Mādhavendra Purī stayed there, and after that he departed the world at that very place of Remuṇā. We have seen there the Samādhi Temple of Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī, a very small and charming Temple."},{"class":"b44","text":" Thus, Mahāprabhu tasted the ecstasy of the story of Mādhava Purī. Mādhavendra Purī, before he disappeared, was very much intoxicated by Kṛṣṇa-prema, divine love, and he felt separation of Kṛṣṇa severely. He was always crying in that separation."},{"class":"b44","text":" Īśvar Purī served Mādhavendra Purī for that last period of his Pastimes in this world. Īśvar Purī rendered his personal service to the last detail, for which Mādhavendra Purī praised him so much. In his deep mood of separation, at that time Mādhavendra Purī sang a particular śloka. Mahāprabhu heard that śloka from Īśvar Purī, and Mahāprabhu tasted that śloka with His devotees in Remuṇā Dhām."},{"class":"b59","text":" ayi dīna-dayārdra nātha he<br />mathurā-nātha kadāvalokyase<br />hṛdayaṁ tvad-aloka-kātaraṁ<br />dayita bhrāmyati kiṁ karomy aham"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Chaitanya-charitāmṛta: Madhya-līlā, 4.197)"},{"class":"b50","text":" Again and again, chanting this śloka, Mahāprabhu was overwhelmed in His ecstasy. Mahāprabhu said that this śloka was the direct words of Rādhārāṇī, revealed in the heart of Mādhavendra Purī.

And that kind of pain in the separation of Kṛṣṇa appeared in the heart of Mādhavendra Purī. Mahāprabhu said that no one in this world can fully understand the substance of this śloka. It was chanted by Rādhārāṇī, and revealed in the heart of Mādhavendra Purī, and he tasted that separation; and now, Gaura Mahāprabhu, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, He is tasting that śloka. There is no fourth person who can taste it properly."},{"class":"b44","text":" When I heard this śloka from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, the question immediately arose in my mind, “Present there is Nityānanda Prabhu, who is the disciple of Mādhavendra Purī, and many other greatly qualified personalities were present there. But Kavirāj Goswāmī said, ‘<span class=\\"e3\\">Ihā āsvādite āra nāhi chauṭha-jana</span>: no fourth person can taste it—that type of wealth is in this śloka.’”"},{"class":"b44","text":" If we try to understand the internal wealth of this śloka, we must fail. Only by the mercy of Rādhārāṇī can it be tasted. When will that day come? Maybe it will never come, no doubt, but by the grace of Rādhārāṇī, in Her nondifferent form of Gurudev, that mood of separation may be revealed in our hearts."},{"class":"b44","text":" We have heard various explanations of this śloka from Guru Mahārāj. And when he was tasting this śloka, I was amazed to see his face. By his extraordinary expression, we could get a glimpse of the great depth of his divine feelings for this highest of the high and finest quality of divine essence."},{"class":"b51","text":" Everything that Mahāprabhu Chaitanyadev gave to the world is within this śloka, as the very gist of Kṛṣṇa-prema. Many varieties of moods of devotion are present within this śloka, and that was explained by Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. How much have we got that? We hesitate even to think about it. And Kavirāj Goswāmī cautioned us to be conscious of our own position:"},{"class":"b60","text":" ei śloka kahiyāchhena rādhā-ṭhākurāṇī<br />tā̐ra kṛpāya sphuriyāchhe mādhavendra-vāṇī"},{"class":"b43","text":" If Rādhārāṇī had not been merciful to Mādhavendra Purī, it was impossible for this to have been revealed in his heart, and he would never have chanted it. And Kṛṣṇa Himself tasted it in the form of Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu, who is Kṛṣṇa with the heart and halo of Rādhārāṇī. Therefore, Kṛṣṇadās Kavirāj says that really there is no fourth person who can taste it."},{"class":"b51","text":" Still, by the grace of Mādhavendra Purī, that mood may be revealed within our hearts. But we cannot expect it. We are living in this mundane world, full of illusion. And when the illusion leaves our vision, and the transcendental world will reveal itself in our hearts and before us, that day we may understand something of it by the grace of Rādhārāṇī in Her nondifferent form of Gurudev.

You please give me permission, and I shall try to make something in Purī Dhām and Vṛndāvan Dhām.” Guru Mahārāj agreed to make something simple in Vṛndāvan, Purī, and Nabadwīp. I also told him that Kolkata was a transit station for the devotees, and a place for them to stop over was also necessary. Guru Mahārāj also gave that permission."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, it was then that Guru Mahārāj said, “If you make something in the Vṛndāvan locality, make it in Govardhan.

My Guru Mahārāj, Prabhupād Śrīla Saraswatī Ṭhākur, said, ‘We shall go from Govardhan, very early in the morning, and on the order of Rādhārāṇī, we shall collect flowers at Kusum Sarovar and collect milk from all around; then we shall go to Rādhā-Kuṇḍa for service, and after Rādhā-Govinda go to sleep, we shall return to our shelter at the lotus feet of Govardhan.’ So, if you want to arrange a place there, make it in Govardhan.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" That was the desire of Śrīla Saraswatī Ṭhākur and Śrīla Guru Mahārāj.

One should not try to get it easily, but it will be easy—by the grace of Guru, by the grace of Rādhārāṇī."},{"class":"b44","text":" Before that, we must wait, and Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī showed us how much it was necessary to wait.

It is nondifferent from Mathurā Maṇḍal. Śrīla Vṛndāvan Dās Ṭhākur has written, “There is no other village in the world like Śrī Nabadwīp where Lord Chaitanya Gosā̐i has descended.” Truly, Śrī Nabadwīp Dhām is the best of all, and there is no other place like it since the most magnanimous, mercy-personified Śrī Gaura Hari appeared in this part of the world. He indiscriminately distributed to all persons, whether they were qualified or unqualified, the highest perfection of love of God, which is difficult for even the demigods to obtain. He has so generously distributed this highest gift even to the most fallen, therefore Śrī Nabadwīp is incomparable in the world."},{"class":"b44","text":" Nearly five hundred years ago, Śrī Nabadwīp city was renowned throughout the world as the centre of learning and knowledge. The science of logic, which was brought from Mithila, was cultured by the intelligentsia of Śrī Nabadwīp, and its fame was spread all over the world. From Benares in northern India, and from many other places, sannyāsīs and the class of professors who were well-read in nyāya and Vedānta all came to Nabadwīp for learning. From Kanchi in southern India, and other places too, many students desirous of becoming well educated all came to Śrī Nabadwīp. “Persons from different places all go to Nabadwīp, for one who studies in Nabadwīp gets the taste for knowledge.

Running madly after the flickering happiness of this world, the conditioned souls judge everything from the point of view of sense gratification, and uselessly waste their time with futile talks within that plane of existence. These things are all intolerable for the devotees. Śrīla Vṛndāvan Dās Ṭhākur writes, “The whole world is devoid of real love for Rāma and Kṛṣṇa.

Even from those who are puffed up with their detachment and renunciation, we never hear the chanting of the Holy Names from their lips.

Those who recite <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> for the education of the people do not have the devotional serving mood in their tongue. Thus, the Lord’s energy produces the worldly illusion. This causes the devotees’ unhappiness to increase without limit. Seeing the whole world devoid of Kṛṣṇa-bhakti, their hearts are burning within.

The Āchārya, who was an ocean of mercy, found the miserable condition of the living entities to be unbearable, and He decided resolutely within Himself that He would call the Lord to personally descend and save the situation. “I will meet Vaikuṇṭhanāth and bring Him here. Dancing and singing, I will deliver all living entities.” The glories of Advaita Āchārya were not unknown to the devotees. All were pleased by hearing the promise of Advaita Āchārya, and they all engaged in His service, having full faith in Him."},{"class":"b44","text":" With this promise fixed in His mind, Śrī Advaita Āchārya meditated on offering Ganges water and tulasī leaves to the Lord, constantly calling to Goloka-bihārī again and again. The Lord’s throne was shaking. The devotees, who were also engaged in calling the Lord, abstained from all comforts and material enjoyment, and to relieve the devotees’ unhappiness, the all-merciful Lord prepared to descend to this world. Needless to say, when the Lord descends, He comes with all His paraphernalia and associates, therefore before the Lord’s descent, the all-auspicious Nityānanda Prabhu, who appeared in Rāḍha Deś, came first to make all the necessary preparations to receive the Lord."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrī Māyāpur is the centre of Nabadwīp Dhām and is called Antardwīp. Śrī Jagannāth Miśra lived at this place, Antardwīp. He was a vastly learned and generous person, and the resort of the purest souls. Śrīla Vṛndāvan Dās Ṭhākur has written, “Nabadwīp is the place of residence of Jagannāth Miśra. He was as devoted to his religious duties as Vāsudev Himself. His magnanimous character was as unlimited as Brahma. No one could compare with him. Formerly he was Kaśyapa, Daśarath, Vāsudev, and Nanda Mahārāj, and now, as Jagannāth Miśra, was the combination of them all. His wife, named Śachī Devī, was completely devoted to her husband. She was the emblem of Kṛṣṇa-bhakti and the mother of the whole world.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" This very pure, divine couple tragically lost eight daughters, but after that they begot a son named Viśvarūp who had uncommonly beautiful features. They always worshipped the Lord in great transcendental ecstasy. Day by day Viśvarūp, who always satisfied his father and mother, grew like the bright half of the waxing moon."},{"class":"b44","text":" Gradually this dark world got the strength of the auspicious planets. In 1406 Śakābda, there was a special day because Śrī Jagannāth Miśra saw a brilliant transcendental ray make its way into his heart, and again from his heart it entered into the heart of Śrī Śachī Devī. Feeling thrilled, Miśra was overwhelmed with joy, and from that day Śachī Devī became transformed into a wonderful embodiment of that transcendental ray. Miśra told Śachī Devī all these things he had observed, and when Śachī Devī confirmed that she had also experienced the same things, it only caused Miśradev to increase his wonder: “I see in the sky as if many heavenly beings are making hymns in praise of me. The whole atmosphere has become delightful with many enlightened persons coming and going from this place.” Noticing all these things, Miśra said with joy, “From these things I can understand that a great personality will be born.” With great attention this divine couple was always performing Viṣṇu worship."},{"class":"b44","text":" On 1407 Śakābda, Phālgun, full moon day, at evening time, the Lord Śrī Gaurachandra was born. On this pleasant spring evening, the day of the full moon, there was also a lunar eclipse. The banks of the Ganges and the roads of the city leading to the Ganges were all filled with throngs of people—a very thick crowd—and all were struggling along the way. Seeing this great crowd of people, one felt as if the whole universe had come here leaving the rest of the fourteen worlds vacant. Everyone was filled with ecstatic bliss. The sound of ‘Hari’ filled up and resounded throughout the fourteen worlds. It was as if all the auspicious signs of the universe were rising at the same time—the splendour of Nabadwīp was so brilliant."},{"class":"b44","text":" An unprecedented vibration of the name of ‘Hari’ resounded from the many devotees gathered on the bank of the Ganges. The flood of Hari-nām made all inauspicious signs disappear on this occasion of the lunar eclipse, and instead brought boundless joy to everyone. As they stood on the banks of the Ganges, everyone was thinking, “Where did so many people come from? Previously there were so many eclipses, but so many persons, and such a great vibration of the sound of Hari, we have never seen or heard any thing like this before, and we are all overwhelmed with joy!” They were all filled with intense happiness, but they could not understand the cause. This was going on, and all without exception were feeling very good. Even fallen persons were laughing in the company of the Hindus, relishing the chanting of ‘Hari, Hari’. There was pleasure in all ten directions, and even the river water was feeling pleased.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" It was a very favourable evening indeed, “Lion rāśi, lion lagna, highly placed planets, the six planets, the eight signs—all auspicious signs were visible.” Everyone was well dressed and decorated for the Lord’s appearance and singing songs. “At that time, the life of the whole world, Lord Śrī Śachī Nandan, appeared.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In Śrī Jagannāth Miśra’s house, there was no limit to the joyful atmosphere found in Śrī Śachī Devī’s room. The whole world was inundated by the flood of Hari-nām as the spotless full moon appeared today. And that is why the moon in the sky covered his face out of shyness (in the lunar eclipse). Why shouldn’t he cover his face? The moons on the Lord’s toenails give such a brilliant, merciful light that they outshine millions of moons, and it is that same Gaurachandra who appeared today."},{"class":"b44","text":" Everywhere, on all sides, flowers were raining from the sky. The sounds of millions of conchshells, beating drums, and the dancing of divine personalities all began at that time. The whole earth resounded with “Jay, jay!” and the entire universe became liberated. The news of the appearance of Gaurahari was thus announced. The devotees directly felt within themselves full satisfaction. The sweet sounds of the conch, bells, mṛdaṅga, and kartāls became sweeter still when mixed with the chorus of, “Jaya Śachī Nandan! Jaya Gaurahari!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Everything connected with Gaurahari is eternal. His Name, Form, Qualities, Pastimes, Associates, and Paraphernalia are all eternal. His appearance is eternal. For those fortunate persons who are pure in heart, the eternal Lord resides in their hearts always. These things cannot be understood by our tiny brains. So, the Lord is achintya-bhedābheda, appearing in the form of Āchāryadev as the highest conclusion of this principle. Only by the grace of sādhu and Guru are we able to know the glory of Śrī Chaitanyadev, who is the eternally pure, fully liberated, ultimate Reality."},{"class":"b51","text":" At that time, those fortunate persons who have received the mercy of the sādhus can understand that Gaurachandra appears as Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the mood of Rādhārāṇī. They feel great ecstasy within their hearts, and they are able to understand, “Today also Gaura Rāy was performing His Pastimes, and only a few fortunate persons were able to see.”"},{"class":"b60","text":" adyāpiha sei līlā kare gaura-rāya<br />kona kona bhāgyavāna dekhibāre pāya"},{"class":"b59","text":" anarpita-charīṁ chirāt karuṇayāvatīrṇaḥ kalau<br />samarpayitum unnatojjvala-rasāṁ sva-bhakti-śriyam<br />hariḥ puraṭa-sundara-dyuti-kadamba-sandīpitaḥ<br />sadā hṛdaya-kandare sphuratu vaḥ śachī-nandanaḥ"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Chaitanya-charitāmṛta: Ādi-līlā, 1.4)"},{"class":"b55","text":" [“May that Lord, who is known as the son of Śrīmatī Śachī Devī, be transcendentally situated in the innermost chambers of your heart.

They expressed that whenever they hear from Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, they feel they are in the shade of Prabhupād Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur."},{"class":"b44","text":" They all gave such honour to our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, and why? Their life’s goal is the service of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Govinda, and they understood that such service is coming through their Śrī Gurudev, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur. But they also saw that their Gurudev had transmitted his divine power to Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, so their idea was that Gurudev’s merciful power is graciously present in our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. It is for this reason that they always came to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj."},{"class":"b44","text":" They had left all their mundane facilities and life’s desires, and joined within the Mission for the service to Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, and to Prabhu Nityānanda and Mahāprabhu. In which way will they get that service? Only the mercy of the Vaiṣṇavas and the mercy of Śrī Guru can give that service. This was very clear to them, so they would all forego any personal position—everything—and come from time to time to see Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. They expressed to him about their preaching work and preaching style, and they felt very happy to see his happiness."},{"class":"b44","text":" So many of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s godbrothers used to attend the meeting of the Viśva Vaiṣṇava Rāja Sabhā organised by our Maṭh. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would always give the presidential chair to Śrīpād Bhakti Sāraṅga Goswāmī Mahārāj. Although Śrīpād Goswāmī Mahārāj took sannyās from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj knew that Śrīpād Goswāmī Mahārāj’s all-round position was so high within the Gauḍīya Mission. He therefore always offered the presidential chair to him."},{"class":"b44","text":" Once, after accepting that presidential chair, Śrīpād Goswāmī Mahārāj gave a particularly special lecture. He explained that he and other great preachers are active in all directions, but they all wait to see how Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj considers the quality of their preaching style. He used the word <span class=\\"e3\\">siṁhāvalokana</span>.

Rūpa Goswāmī Prabhu is supreme in the preceptorial line of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. Actually, no one says, ‘Chaitanya sampradāya’. Rather, the correct name is Rūpānuga sampradāya. Mahāprabhu wanted to establish Rūpa Goswāmī as the Guru of His sampradāya. That same current of Rūpa Goswāmī is flowing through Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. This is the cause that all the devotees of Śrīla Saraswatī Ṭhākur respect Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. They always saw it, and still to this day they see it in this way."},{"class":"b44","text":" Rūpa Goswāmī Prabhu was established by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu.

The expression is given there clearly."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Mahāprabhu appeared, He showed His effulgence as the Lord. At that time Rūpa and Sanātan were the chief administrators in the Bengal government, yet they were devoted to Kṛṣṇa. They felt that Kṛṣṇa would appear at that time, and they tried to understand where He would appear."},{"class":"b44","text":" When they saw the exalted effulgence of Mahāprabhu, they observed Him and came to see Him. It was clear to them that, “He is our dearmost Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Here He has appeared!” This was the special connection Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Sanātan had with the Lord. At that time their names were Dabir Khās and Sākar Mallik respectively. Sanātan Goswāmī was the prime minister, and Rūpa Goswāmī was the finance minister. They externally showed themselves as government servants, but internally they always hankered for Kṛṣṇa-prema. They saw Nimāi Paṇḍit, Mahāprabhu Gaurasundar, as the shining bulb."},{"class":"b44","text":" Many other devotees knew the divine personality of Mahāprabhu of the infinite world, and had connection with Him. These devotees included Advaita Āchārya, Haridās Ṭhākur, Śrīvās Paṇḍit, Gadādhar Paṇḍit, and Puṇḍarīk Vidyānidhi."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, Rūpa and Sanātan secretly came to see Mahāprabhu, and it was very clear to them that He was in fact their Lord; and they tried to serve Him. The devotees would meet together and plan their future programme."},{"class":"b44","text":" They knew Mahāprabhu would take sannyās, and they awaited that day. When eventually Rūpa and Sanātan heard Mahāprabhu had indeed taken sannyās, they became even more attached to Him. When Mahāprabhu tried to go to Vṛndāvan through Nabadwīp and Rāmakeli, thousands of people followed Mahāprabhu in saṅkīrtan. At that time, Rūpa and Sanātan secretly met with Mahāprabhu in the village of Rāmakeli."},{"class":"b44","text":" Rūpa and Sanātan lived near Rāmakeli.

Go back and do your jobs.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" Earlier Rūpa and Sanātan had written many letters to Mahāprabhu, and Mahāprabhu had encouraged them, saying,"},{"class":"b60","text":" para-vyasaninī nārī vyagrāpi gṛha-karmasu<br />tad evāsvādayaty antar nava-saṅga-rasāyanam"},{"class":"b43","text":" “Be like a paramour lover who always thinks of her lover but outwardly does all the usual duties within the family.

You are both my eternal servitors, so you have no fear from anywhere. Kṛṣṇa will help you.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Before going back they explained, “O Mahāprabhu, the king here is Muslim. No doubt he is sympathetic towards You, but if he sees this large following, he may change his mind. If You go with these thousands and thousands of people, the king may feel some threat from You and try to harm You.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Later Rūpa met with Mahāprabhu when He was on his way back from Vṛndāvan. Mahāprabhu taught Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī and gave him the charge of organising His Mission in Mathurā and Vṛndāvan. Mahāprabhu instructed him to reveal the lost holy places of Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes, and to compose scriptures to relay the teachings that He would impart to him. Mahāprabhu Himself was the teacher of Rūpa Goswāmī, and He expected that Rūpa Goswāmī would be the leader of His sampradāya."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu met with Rūpa Goswāmī in Prayag, and He met with Sanātan Goswāmī in Benares. Both of these goswāmīs are the direct students of Mahāprabhu Śrī Chaitanyadev. Mahāprabhu did not teach others as a teacher but as an adviser, but He personally taught Rūpa and Sanātan Goswāmī. They learnt from Mahāprabhu as students, and Mahāprabhu made them into masters in the line of His divine conception. That was the first stage of the manifestation of Śrī Rūpa Goswāmī."},{"class":"b44","text":" Later Rūpa Goswāmī met again with Mahāprabhu in Nīlāchal. At that time Mahāprabhu received Rūpa Goswāmī as His son. Mahāprabhu did not break any of the laws of Jagannāth Kṣetra, so he gave shelter to Haridās Ṭhākur in a thatched garden-house of Tapan Miśra. When Rūpa Goswāmī came there, He also gave him shelter in that garden along with Haridās Ṭhākur. When Sanātan would come to meet with Mahāprabhu, he would also stay with Haridās Ṭhākur."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu’s nature was to not disturb the environment. Sympathetic dealings with nature is the best attitude for Vaiṣṇavism. Our Guru Mahārāj said that actual varṇāśram-dharma is to deal sympathetically with nature. Varṇāśram is organised so as not to disturb the natural flow within this world. Within that flow we can manifest our divine practising life through our activity, so there is no necessity to disturb that."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu did not want to establish brāhmaṇism, an external thing, but what He gave was far superior. His gift is superior to any ‘ism’. He taught Rūpa Goswāmī in Prayag and told His associates, “You will come to see just how qualified he is.” Establishing Rūpa Goswāmī as His best student, He threw open a challenge to all the experts, such as Rāmānanda Rāy, Svarūp Dāmodar, Sārvabhauma Paṇḍit, Bhagavān Āchārya, Śikhi Māhiti, and many paṇḍits of the king, who were followers of Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. There were hundreds of very big personalities who were associates of Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. Furthermore, Mahāprabhu considered Rāmānanda Rāy as an equal to Himself, or even more—as Guru."},{"class":"b44","text":" Svarūp Dāmodar is considered as a second manifestation of Mahāprabhu (<span class=\\"e3\\">śākṣāt Mahāprabhura dvitīya svarūpa</span>). However, Mahāprabhu decided that His sampradāya, His succession, would be through Rūpa Goswāmī. He did not say that it will go through Svarūp Dāmodar although he was considered to be almost more than Mahāprabhu. If anyone wanted to offer Mahāprabhu a poem or any composition, it would come first to Svarūp Dāmodar, and if it was agreeable to him, only then would it be presented to Mahāprabhu. Without this process, none could go directly to Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu wanted to learn from Rāmānanda Rāy when they were on the banks of the Godāvarī. “<span class=\\"e3\\">Eka Rāmānanda haya ei adhikāra</span>: he is a living mukta-puruṣa. No one else can behave like Rāmānanda Rāy within this mundane plane.” Although Mahāprabhu gave him such a great certificate, He did not show His succession there."},{"class":"b44","text":" Instead, Mahāprabhu made Rūpa Goswāmī His successor and presented him in an assembly of all the generals. Mahāprabhu told them, “Test this man.” Rāmānanda Rāy was the judge, and he questioned Rūpa Goswāmī about his plays <span class=\\"e3\\">Lalita-Mādhava</span> and <span class=\\"e3\\">Vidagdha-mādhava</span>.

He questioned Rūpa Goswāmī on the style in which he had written various parts of the plays, and also posed many questions about Rūpa Goswāmī’s opinions. Rūpa Goswāmī answered them perfectly, one by one. Everyone in that assembly was stunned, including Haridās Ṭhākur, who was the first person to preach the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra, before even Mahāprabhu by a few years."},{"class":"b44","text":" Several times Haridās Ṭhākur had undergone great austerity and trials. He was even beaten in twenty-two market places by guards intending to kill him. He faced so many tests, but he crossed them all, and showed the glories of Śrī Hari-nām.

The Lord did not stop there: “It is not sufficient for Me to say that I have given My mercy. I want you all to give your mercy and blessings to Rūpa that he will give My conception in this world.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" They replied, “When You have given Your grace, that is sufficient.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" But Mahāprabhu objected, “No, it is not sufficient.

Kavi Karṇapūr was the son of Śivānanda Sen. When he was still in the womb, Mahāprabhu instructed Śivānanda Sen to give him the name Purī Dās. However, when he was born, Śivānanda Sen gave the name Chaitanya Dās instead. When the boy was young, not more than five years old, he came with his father to see Mahāprabhu. The Lord asked his name. Someone said it is Chaitanya Dās, and Mahāprabhu was a little shy and objected, “No, his name is Purī Dās. Why have you given him the name Chaitanya Dās?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu then gave good nourishment to that boy. He instructed him, “O Purī Dās, now you chant the Holy Names. Chant ‘Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare.’” But that boy would not say anything. Twice and thrice Mahāprabhu insisted that he chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Mahāprabhu was surprised. He thought, “The whole world is chanting the Holy Names of Kṛṣṇa as soon as I tell them to chant, but this boy cannot chant! What is this?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He asked Svarūp Dāmodar why this boy did not chant: “Everyone chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra when I instruct them, but not this boy. Why won’t he chant?” Svarūp Dāmodar replied, “Oh, that boy has just been initiated by You. He feels You are the World Guru, You are Kṛṣṇa Himself, and You have just given him initiation. He has just received the mantram from You, therefore he is not saying it outwardly.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Surprised, Mahāprabhu said, “This boy is very intelligent!” In this way Purī Dās received his special initiation. That Purī Dās was later known by the name Kavi Karṇapūr, and he composed <span class=\\"e3\\">Chaitanya-chandrodaya-nāṭaka</span>, an inconceivably excellent play. We cannot believe it humanly possible to write such a play. He graced that play with all the wealth of Chaitanya Mahāprabhu.

Rūpa Goswāmī is the supreme personality in Mahāprabhu Chaitanyadev’s sampradāya, and he carries the preceptorial line of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. This is the history, a very serious subject matter.

Until this very day, that particular devotional prayer is the life of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas.

While on the banks of the river, He began to call, “Narottam, Narottam, Narottam.” The devotees could not understand the meaning at that time, but later it was revealed that from that part of Bengal, a great devotee would appear, and his name would be ‘Narottam’. Śrīman Mahāprabhu had left a great treasure stored in the waters of Padmā Devī for Narottam—Kṛṣṇa-prema."},{"class":"b44","text":" After many years, Narottam Dās Ṭhākur appeared in the village of that area known as Kheturi. He was a prince, the only son of Rāja Kṛṣṇānanda Datta and Rāṇī Nārāyaṇī Devī. Narottam was enlightened even from his early childhood, and one day he had a dream in which Nityānanda Prabhu instructed him, “Go to the River Padmā and take your bath there because Mahāprabhu has left His gift of Kṛṣṇa-prema for you within her waters.” Narottam immediately awoke, went to the river, and entered the water. While bathing he experienced the divine form of Mahāprabhu embracing him, and Kṛṣṇa-prema entered into his being. He became transformed, and just like Mahāprabhu Himself, he began crying, dancing, laughing, and constantly chanting the Names of Kṛṣṇa; suddenly <span class=\\"e3\\">aṣṭa-sāttvika-bhāva</span> [the eight symptoms of ecstasy in love of Kṛṣṇa] appeared in his body."},{"class":"b44","text":" Upon returning home, Narottam’s mother began to question, “O my son, what has happened to you? Why are you crying and behaving in this peculiar way? Please, if I can help in any way, I am ready to do anything. I am even ready to give up my life if that will help you. Tell me what I can do.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Narottam replied, “Mother, last night I went to the River Padmā, inspired by a dream, and there someone who I believe was Chaitanya Mahāprabhu embraced me and entered into my heart. Now I am feeling great sadness and separation from that Mahāprabhu and from Śrī Kṛṣṇachandra, and that is what causes me to cry. If you wish to show your kindness to me, then please give me permission to go to Vṛndāvan where I shall search for Mahāprabhu.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" After hearing Narottam’s petition, his father became worried, fearing that his son would leave home, and so, just like the father of Raghunāth Dās Goswāmī, he arranged some guards to watch Narottam. Narottam remained in the house, chanting, dancing, writing devotional songs, and always manifesting the eight symptoms of divine ecstasy."},{"class":"b44","text":" Narottam was restless, always crying for Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa. Since the day he took his bath in the river, his body had changed from his dark complexion, and he had become the same golden colour as Mahāprabhu. Rādhārāṇī’s colour had come into his body, and everyone was greatly surprised saying, “Yes, it is true, Narottam has received Kṛṣṇa-prema from Mahāprabhu, and Mahāprabhu is really living in his heart.” Everyone was offering him respect, but his father was becoming more and more worried."},{"class":"b44","text":" One day, when his father had gone to pay taxes on behalf of the state and had travelled far away, Narottam went to his mother crying in great anguish and again petitioned her, “Mother, please give your permission. I must go to Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s associates who are living in Vṛndāvan. It is the order of Nityānanda Prabhu, so please arrange for me to go.” Narottam’s mother made the arrangements, and in secret Narottam left his home and went to Vṛndāvan."},{"class":"b44","text":" Narottam had been having many dreams in which Mahāprabhu instructed him to go to Vṛndāvan and take shelter of the lotus feet of His confidential devotee Śrīla Lokanāth Dās Goswāmī, who would give dīkṣā to him. He also told Narottam to find Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī, Śrīla Sanātan Goswāmī, and Śrīla Jīva Goswāmī, and to keep their holy association. After arriving in Vṛndāvan, Narottam found that Rūpa and Sanātan had already left the world, but he found there Śrīla Jīva Goswāmī, Śrīla Lokanāth Dās Goswāmī, Śrīla Kṛṣṇadās Kavirāj Goswāmī, and many other great Vaiṣṇavas who gave him their company. Narottam became the student of Jīva Goswāmī and petitioned Lokanāth Goswāmī to give him dīkṣā. Lokanāth refused him."},{"class":"b44","text":" Lokanāth Goswāmī had decided that he would never accept any disciples and lived in an extremely austere way in Vṛndāvan, living under a different tree every night. Narottam felt great sadness upon being refused by Śrīla Lokanāth, and he told him, “I can only take my initiation from you. Śrīman Mahāprabhu has told me that you will give me dīkṣā, so until then I will wait.” Narottam tried to serve his Guru, but the goswāmī would allow no one to serve him. Narottam thought, “If he will not even stay under the same tree for more than one night, then what kind of service can I do for him?” After a while, Narottam noticed that Śrīla Lokanāth Prabhu would always go to the same place to pass stool, and he began to think that although Lokanāth had refused to give him any service for over two years, if he could clean that place every day, then at last he would have some service. Narottam was fixed in his resolve that he must take dīkṣā from Śrīla Lokanāth Goswāmī, as this was the order of Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" Very soon Lokanāth Goswāmī began to notice, “I come here every day to pass stool, and it seems that someone is cleaning this place after me. Who can be doing this?” So, one night from a hidden place, Lokanāth saw that at midnight Narottam is coming and very happily cleaning that place. Lokanāth knew that Narottam was the son of the famous king Kṛṣṇānanda Datta. He was greatly astonished and confronted Narottam, “Why are you, a prince of high noble birth, coming each night and cleaning this dirty place?” Narottam replied, “Prabhu, I need your mercy. Without your mercy I cannot live. Your vow is that you will not accept any disciples, but by the order of Śrīman Mahāprabhu, it is my vow that I must have your connection. I don’t know when you will give me your mercy, but you must accept me as your disciple.” So, after refusing Narottam eighteen times, finally Śrīla Lokanāth Dās Goswāmī took Narottam Dās and gave him dīkṣā."},{"class":"b44","text":" Narottam received instruction from Śrīla Jīva Goswāmī, Śrīla Kavirāj Goswāmī, and many other goswāmīs who were there in Vṛndāvan. He was a great paṇḍit, and all the devotees headed by Śrī Jīva, recognising his qualification, bestowed upon him the title of ‘Ṭhākur’."},{"class":"b44","text":" Narottam Ṭhākur’s close associates and peers were Śyāmānanda and Śrīnivās. From the inspiration of Śrīla Jīva Goswāmī and the other Vaiṣṇavas, these three great devotees were sent back to Bengal to continue the preaching of Mahāprabhu. The Bengali Vaiṣṇavas were very eager to read the writings of Śrī Rūpa, Sanātan, Raghunāth, Kṛṣṇadās Kavirāj, Lokanāth Goswāmī, Gopāl Bhaṭṭa Goswāmī, Prabhodānanda Saraswatī, and the other goswāmīs; so Narottam, Śyāmānanda, and Śrīnivās travelled from Vṛndāvan towards Bengal with many copies of those great books."},{"class":"b44","text":" Finally they arrived in Viṣṇupur in the district of Birbhum, Bengal. The king of this region was Rāja Bīr Hambīr, but he was a dacoit [bandit] and was engaged in many robberies in the area. The king had a brāhmaṇ astrologer, and according to the astrologer’s calculations, he would know where and when to carry out his next robbery. The astrologer informed the king that on a particular route bullock carts would be passing, carrying many precious jewels, so the jubilant king sent his dacoits to rob the caravan. While Narottam and the Vaiṣṇavas slept, the king’s dacoits stole away the chests containing the books of the goswāmīs."},{"class":"b44","text":" After much searching, Narottam, Śrīnivās, and Śyāmānanda in great sorrow could not trace the books. Śrīnivās ordered Narottam to return to Kheturi Grām, and Śyāmānanda went to Midnapur, where they began preaching. Śrīnivās Āchārya resolved to stay and try to find the stolen books."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīnivās heard that in the assembly of Rāja Bīr Hambīr that night, a great paṇḍit would give explanation of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>.

Śrīnivās agreed."},{"class":"b44","text":" After hearing the paṇḍit’s explanation of <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span>, Śrīnivās addressed Rāja Bīr Hambīr saying, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> is not child’s play.

All those that heard him became greatly moved, and they all, including the king, took shelter of his lotus feet."},{"class":"b44","text":" The king humbly approached Śrīnivās, “Prabhu, you are indeed a great Vaiṣṇava. Please tell me what service I can do for you? Where have you come from? How far have you travelled?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīnivās Āchārya told him, “I have come from Vṛndāvan carrying chests of books written by the goswāmīs, but now they are lost, stolen by I know not who, so, I remain here searching for them.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" With his head bowed Rāja Bīr Hambīr announced, “I am the culprit. I have those books in my home, and every day I have been worshipping them. My astrologer told me that his calculations were true and that the books were actually jewels although they were in the form of books, and so that is why every day I am offering pūjā.” The king took Śrīnivās to the books."},{"class":"b44","text":" The news was sent to Narottam and Śyāmānanda, and in great jubilation Narottam Ṭhākur arranged a grand festival. As well as Narottam, Śyāmānanda, Śrīnivās, and other noted Vaiṣṇavas, Mother Jāhnavā Devī—Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu’s śakti—also came there to Kheturi Grām to attend the festival. After properly worshipping Jāhnavā Devī, Narottam Ṭhākur installed six Deities in different Temples: Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Vallavī Kānta, Vraja Mohan, Rādhā Kānta, Rādhā Rāmaṇ, and Gaurāṅga. Elaborate pūjā arrangements were made, including a month-long festival of Hari-kīrtan. And every day in Narottam’s kīrtan, those who were fortunate saw Nityānanda Prabhu and Mahāprabhu dancing there, such was Narottam’s devotion. Those who knew him considered he was the incarnation of Nityānanda Prabhu and Mahāprabhu combined."},{"class":"b44","text":" Although Lokanāth Goswāmī only had one disciple, Narottam gave Kṛṣṇa-prema to everyone, and just like Nityānanda Prabhu, he did not consider who was fit and who was not. Whoever wanted Kṛṣṇa-prema, Narottam would give it them. He was given this special power by the grace of Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda, and Lokanāth Goswāmī, Narottam’s Gurudev."},{"class":"b44","text":" Narottam Dās Ṭhākur was born in the kāyastha community, and caused a great deal of controversy by accepting disciples who were from the brāhmaṇ caste. The brāhmaṇ section were very angry with him and tried repeatedly to defeat him in debate, but the only result was that more brāhmaṇs were becoming his disciples. The brāhmaṇs were very unhappy, and when in his last years Narottam manifested much sickness, the brāhmaṇs declared that this was the result of Narottam violating the scriptural injunctions by accepting disciples from a higher caste than his own. Gradually, Narottam’s condition became worse and finally he died. The brāhmaṇs were jubilant and began celebrating Narottam’s passing as proof of his offences to their community."},{"class":"b44","text":" Narottam’s disciples were heartbroken and prayed before their Gurudev’s body, “O Prabhu, you have shown this līlā of your passing in this way, and the brāhmaṇs are committing offence to your lotus feet because they cannot understand. Lord, what shall we do now? Surely all the preaching will be ruined if you show this kind of passing līlā. Please show your mercy to these misguided brāhmaṇs.” Suddenly, Narottam returned to his body and sat up, and upon seeing this miracle, the opposition surrendered to his lotus feet."},{"class":"b44","text":" Some months later, Narottam was exhibiting intense symptoms of separation from Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and so again he left this world. His body turned into milk and merged with the waters of the holy River Ganges."},{"class":"b52","text":" In this way, Narottam Dās Ṭhākur preached Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and from him the preceptorial line is coming to Viśvanāth Chakravartī.

There is no doubt that everybody shall die one day, so if we give too much attention for our health, it is not good for us. Actually, we must give our attention for the service of Guru-Gaurāṅga, and if we leave this body through that service, it is very good. In fact, there is no higher good than that.

Until I finally took sannyās, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj did not make his final Will and Testament. A few days ago, I read an earlier will. Perhaps he was very sick at that time, anyhow, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj added in his own handwriting that now his health was very bad and he may die. He wrote that if Govinda Mahārāj will take sannyās, he must be the Āchārya here, and he wrote that if he should pass away before Govinda Mahārāj takes sannyās, everyone will wait five years for him to take the renounced order of life. He will then take the Āchārya’s position, but in the meantime none else will take that position of Āchārya of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh. Only if Govinda Mahārāj does not take sannyās within that five years will another be selected as Āchārya.

But in which way will it be possible? Many varieties of circumstances come, and many varieties of difficulties come.

Both the show and the substance are necessary in this mundane world, otherwise we cannot attract the general people. They are living in the mundane world, therefore, to attract them it is necessary to make a good, attractive cover."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the goswāmīs’ books, everything is apparently simple, but inside that, everything given there is rich. Our own Maṭh’s <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</span> externally is a big book looking like a dictionary, but internally our <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</span> is greatly rich with knowledge with the explanations of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Similarly, all our centres need to have an external form and an internal form. Anyhow we will harmonise."},{"class":"b44","text":" Harmony. Harmony is Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s conception. When He went to South India to preach, He visited every type of temple, such as those of Gaṇeś, Kālī, Śiva, Durgā, and other deities. Why did He visit all types of temples? He did so in order that He could reach the people to present to them the ultimate goal of life."},{"class":"b44","text":" The conception of the Rāmānuja sampradāya is that they will never go to a Śiva temple. They have a saying that if a tiger will come to kill you, you may go to the mouth of the tiger but not to a Śiva temple, even if you will get safety there! They have such a type of conception."},{"class":"b44","text":" However, Mahāprabhu was not like that. He went to every temple He came across along His path of preaching. But everywhere Mahāprabhu went, He only preached the Kṛṣṇa conception. He gave Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all, and everyone took to Mahāprabhu’s religion. He went to Gaṇeś temples, and the worshippers of Gaṇeś took to Mahāprabhu’s religion. In that way, He preached everywhere, and our conception also will be like that. Our intention will be like that."},{"class":"b44","text":" We do not hate others. If we will hate, then they will go out. Therefore, we must follow Mahāprabhu’s conception of not hating any religion, but giving them Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So, we must always make harmony with others, otherwise this type of preaching is not possible."},{"class":"b44","text":" In which way shall we be able to harmonise everything?

When he met them, he suddenly saw, “Here Mahāprabhu is present in them!” He wanted to leave his body by jumping from Girirāj Govardhan, but when he saw Śrī Rūpa–Sanātan, he again got life and abandoned his former plan.

That is His harmonising capacity, we can say."},{"class":"b44","text":" Each of our centres worldwide must first themselves practise in the way of Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, and I think that what I am preaching in this regard is perfect.

If I shall not claim this with my full energy, then I shall be an offender to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj because Śrīla Guru Mahārāj believed that I am capable. I am trying, and everybody knows it.

He was in the highest position of the whole Vaiṣṇava community, but he never joined with their missions. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj did not want to be deviated from his own vision by any of his godbrothers or other Gurus, therefore he made Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh.

Someone is giving sahajiyā saṅkīrtan in their maṭh, but it is not possible for me to do like this in Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh. That is the exclusiveness of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj in his service to the Rūpānuga sampradāya, and I cannot break it.

Not only that, but he did not want to make many Maṭhs, that was his desire. But I was very enthusiastic to do something for the devotees, and he mercifully gave me the instruction, “Yes, you can do one in Kolkata as the devotees’ transit station, and one you can do in Purī and one in Vṛndāvan.” That is: Purī, Vṛndāvan, and Nabadwīp, and, “Don’t make many Maṭhs”; that was Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s instruction."},{"class":"b44","text":" It was not his full desire that I make many Maṭhs, but looking after the eagerness of the devotees, he accepted this, and in his lifetime, we have done it, so we have no problem.

I met the proprietor, within five minutes the sale was settled, and within just fifteen days it was registered."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our prayer to Lord Jagannāth, Lord Baladev, and Lady Subhadrā should be: “Kindly grant us some opportunity to render service at Jagannāth Purī.” Śrīla Guru Mahārāj gave a clue to bhajan life under Paṇḍit Gadādhar. Our Maṭh is near his Temple, the Temple of Ṭoṭā Gopīnāth.

At that time, several Deities of Mahāprabhu were there but not of Nityānanda Prabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" In Nabadwīp, we were already keeping two Deities: Śrī Nitāi and Śrī Chaitanyadev. It was at first the desire of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj that these Deities of Nityānanda Prabhu and Mahāprabhu would play in Govinda Kuṇḍa opposite the Temple here in Nabadwīp, and still it is in my mind to try to manifest such a project here. I would like to do it this year itself, and I have asked one good carpenter devotee to come. He can do so much sevā in the Centenary Hall, and especially he can make a nice siṁhāsan [throne] and a boat for Śrī Śrī Nitāi-Gaurāṅga’s Pastimes in Govinda Kuṇḍa. It has been my hidden desire to do this, and I have already purchased some teak wood especially for this project."},{"class":"b44","text":" When I asked Śrīla Guru Mahārāj if I could take these Śrī Śrī Nitāi-Gaura Deities from here to Purī, he agreed, and said that if I wish, I may take them."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, by the grace and will of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, when our Purī Maṭh manifested, Mahāprabhu accepted the Name of ‘Chaitanya’ and went with Nitāi to Purī for Their Pastimes. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj honoured these Deities, and he touched the feet of Them both. They are very exalted and very heavy."},{"class":"b44","text":" Previously there was no kīrtan written for the particular ārati of Śrī Śrī Nitāi-Chaitanya. Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur had previously composed the Pañcha Tattva ārati (<span class=\\"e3\\">Jaya jaya Gaurāchā̐der āratika śobhā</span>), and he composed the Yugala ārati (<span class=\\"e3\\">Jaya jaya Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa-yugala-milan</span>) for the worship of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, but no kīrtan had been composed for Mahāprabhu and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa on one altar.

Also, Śrī Gadādhar Paṇḍit sometimes invited Mahāprabhu to take prasādam there. Every day, Śrī Gadādhar Paṇḍit would offer bhog to the Deities in his Ashram, and sometimes he would offer that to Mahāprabhu, who would immediately come and accept it. Śrī Gadādhar Paṇḍit did not buy anything, but would somehow collect all ingredients.

For the last twelve years, Mahāprabhu lived in Purī in an extreme mood of separation in the Gambhīrā. When Mahāprabhu was so intoxicated with Kṛṣṇa-prema in the Gambhīrā, and constantly in the mood of separation from Kṛṣṇa, and crying, crying, crying, at that time Gadādhar Paṇḍit would go there and give nourishment through his reading of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu considered every letter of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> to be a manifestation of Kṛṣṇa, and when He heard it from Gadādhar Paṇḍit’s lotus mouth, He felt so much peace and felt Himself to be fully nourished.

Śrī Gadādhar Paṇḍit is Rādhārāṇī minus the mood of Herself, that having been taken by Mahāprabhu. Śrī Gadādhar Paṇḍit is the incarnation of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, but he is subdued. However, this is of another plane, and it is all full."},{"class":"b44","text":" A short while after Mahāprabhu took sannyās it was decided by the devotees in Śāntipur and agreed by Śachī Mātā that Mahāprabhu would stay in Jagannāth Purī.

They will see these places and try to feel in their heart the mood of union in separation shown by Śrīman Mahāprabhu, and they will offer prayers to the associates of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu.

Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was questioned many times by the Western devotees as to how one should see Nabadwīp Dhām, and he clearly explained that it is chinmay-bhūmi. So, we should see the Dhām in this way, and not with any mundane view."},{"class":"b44","text":" The matter is that when we shall go to the Dhām, we shall try to live and feel where we are going: the feeling should come that it is the transcendental Dhām, and Mahāprabhu’s Pastimes with His devotees are always going on."},{"class":"b44","text":" My own mood is that I do not go every day to the Temple of Lord Jagannāth, but I go before Jagannāth in His Temple, and I say to Him in this way: “My daṇḍavat praṇāms to Your lotus feet.

Today we have very happily come to Śrīpāṭ Hapaniya Dhām. Our destination is Goloka, even if we may not know where Goloka is. However, we must know that the abode of Goloka has personally become manifest in this world as the abode of the Divine Master, the residence of the devotees, and the Temple where the Deities are worshipped. Today, whether we can perceive it or not, we have arrived in this holy place which is nondifferent from Goloka Dhām."},{"class":"b44","text":" Many years ago, we brought our Divine Master back here to Hapaniya, the place of his advent. We had a purpose, as also did the residents of this village, and all wanted to have Guru Mahārāj’s company once again, since so many long years had passed since Guru Mahārāj left his family to accept the renounced order of life, sannyās, and went out to preach throughout the whole of India, after which Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur departed from this mortal world, and Guru Mahārāj remained in Vṛndāvan, Gokula, and Śrī Nabadwīp Dhām. His family members, especially his brothers Śrīyukta Maṇi Bābu and Śrīyukta Amar Bābu, tried their level best to bring Guru Mahārāj back to his ‘home town’ Hapaniya, but he had no desire to come here and never agreed to their proposal."},{"class":"b44","text":" Afterwards, on the request of Guru Mahārāj’s godbrothers, Param Pūjyapād Śrīla Jājāvar Mahārāj, Paramahaṁsa Mahārāj, Madhusūdan Mahārāj, and others—all the Vaiṣṇavas who had much regard and affection for him—Guru Mahārāj finally agreed to come here for a day or two."},{"class":"b44","text":" My underlying intention through all this was to locate the exact spot where Guru Mahārāj took his birth. I thought that could be indicated only by him personally. No one else could do that because all were younger than him. He was the eldest remaining of all his family members of the village, and furthermore, his memory was the sharpest of all. Therefore, I considered that only he could accurately point out the place of his birth."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Jājāvar Mahārāj and other godbrothers of Guru Mahārāj, and myself, petitioned Guru Mahārāj to come back here once, Kṛṣṇadās Bābājī Mahārāj also supported our proposal with great enthusiasm. He personally became most eager that Guru Mahārāj should come. Our most revered Śrīyukta Maṇi Bābu and Śrīyukta Amar Bābu were most enthusiastic. Also Śrīyukta Satyen Bābu, Śrīyukta Bon Bābu, and many other distinguished brāhmaṇs and pious souls of the village and their families—all showed great eagerness. Young and old—everyone, even one elderly Muslim gentleman who lived nearby also expressed his heartfelt wish that Guru Mahārāj might be brought back here once again. In this way, everyone propitiated Guru Mahārāj, and at last he agreed."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Guru Mahārāj reached here, I requested him to indicate the place of his birth. Guru Mahārāj happily agreed to do so, and the very spot directly before us where Śrī Śrī Guru Gaurāṅga Rādhā Gopīnāth Jīu now graciously preside, was indicated by him to be the exact place of his birth."},{"class":"b44","text":" On that day we collected 6,000 rupees for making a small place of worship here, to mark the spot. All the venerable godbrothers of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj who were present also graciously gave me contributions. Then at the request of Kṛṣṇadās Bābājī Mahārāj, Jājāvar Mahārāj, and others, Maṇi Bābu registered a deed and gave it to me for this place. Although it was a very small beginning, I was encouraged very much by the blessings and association of Guru Mahārāj’s brothers and my godbrothers. Śrīyukta Amar Bābu took full charge of the project, and in a very humble way we tried to make a small Temple only for the worship of Guru Mahārāj’s photograph. Originally, there was no Temple for the Deity or any Naṭ Mandir. Gradually, the devotees became more and more enthused to give contributions, and so after about eight years I thought that with our Guru Mahārāj’s permission it would now be possible to build a Temple here and install Deities."},{"class":"b44","text":" Guru Mahārāj was also very happy to hear that I wanted to install Deities here. He said, “I am sure you will have no problem to engage a good priest, invite the Vaiṣṇavas, and hold a grand festival for the installation of the Deities. But after that, how will you feed your Deities? It is not a matter of one or two years—it is an eternal service. So, first you will have to try to manage for a permanent arrangement for the worship of the Deities.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" By the blessings of Guru Mahārāj and through the affection of my godbrothers, sufficient facility came to enable me to arrange regular offerings and worship for the Deities. So, taking Guru Mahārāj’s instruction, with the guidance of his honourable godbrothers we installed the Deities of Śrī Śrī Guru Gaurāṅga Rādhā Gopīnāth Jīu. Since then, we have held four grand festivals every year, and we continue the daily worship of the Deities according to the scriptural regulations."},{"class":"b44","text":" Guru Mahārāj named the Deities ‘Rādhā Gopīnāth Jīu’. This name causes us to always remember Mādhavendra Purīpād. Mādhavendra Purī received profuse blessings and sweet rice prasādam from Gopīnāth Jīu of Remuṇā. So, Guru Mahārāj said that since the Deity had manifest Himself here as Gopīnāth Jīu, we must arrange very nice paramānna or sweet rice to offer to Him every day."},{"class":"b44","text":" Gradually, the Temple and Naṭ Mandir has manifested by the blessings of Guru Mahārāj and the affection of the devotees. Along with his family, Guru Mahārāj›s brother, Śrīpād Amar Bābu, constantly serves this Maṭh. Guru Mahārāj named this Maṭh ‘Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Ashram’, and up to the present it is running very happily and perfectly under the guidance of Amar Bābu. As at Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh, all the spiritual functions are carried out every day, and devotees and villagers from far and wide come to see Gopīnāth Jīu. Hundreds of villagers come for the festivals like Rādhāṣṭamī and Kṛṣṇa Janmāṣṭamī. On Janmāṣṭamī, they come for the worship of Gopīnāth Jīu, and they observe fasting the whole day. The next day, for the great festival known as Nandotsav, five to six thousand people attend this Maṭh and happily take prasādam. They all cooperate with us very nicely. In this way, the service of Gopīnāth Jīu has become very glorious. We are also very happy because Guru Mahārāj’s orders to make these service programmes have become fulfilled. Today, you have also seen the new land we have acquired, and the pond which we have named ‘Śānti Sarovar’."},{"class":"b44","text":" There, we are now cultivating our own crops. Devotees of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh now visit here regularly, especially for the festivals of Gaura Pūrṇimā, Guru Pūjā, and Janmāṣṭamī, and they are very happy to see the service of Gopināth Jīu and take His prasādam, and they feel transcendental ecstasy. Thus, our service is always progressing with the kind assistance of the devotees."},{"class":"b44","text":" Today, so many of you have again attended, and this year my programme is a little different. Guru Mahārāj’s form is transcendental, never mundane, and on the holy day of his advent we worship him in the same way as Lord Kṛṣṇa or Mahāprabhu. Therefore, I thought that after his Appearance Day Festival, which we observed yesterday in Nabadwīp, we should hold a festival here today for Guru Mahārāj in the same way as Nandotsav, the festival held by Nanda Mahārāj the day after Kṛṣṇa’s birth. Everything here is transcendental, and if we can have the vision to see this, we must be spiritually benefitted. In this way, we are trying to fulfil the desire of the exalted Vaiṣṇavas."},{"class":"b44","text":" The name of this village is ‘Hapaniya’, which means ‘sweet water’. A place that produces sweet water is called ‘Hapaniya’. <span class=\\"e3\\">Pānīya</span> means ‘that which is drinkable’. Today, we have drunk the water from the green coconuts here and experienced their sweetness. Because of these coconuts full of sweet water, this place has been called ‘Hapaniya’."},{"class":"b44","text":" Another feeling also comes to me when I am in Hapaniya, as a child of this village. Perhaps in the past I was a resident of this village. I do not know why, but whenever I come here, I feel myself to be a part of this village. Perhaps it is because of the affection of Guru Mahārāj’s family members. I first came here when I was seventeen years old. At that time, Maṇi Bābu, Amar Bābu, and their families were very affectionate to me and bestowed their blessings upon me, and Guru Mahārāj’s sister, who now lives at Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh in Nabadwīp—she accepted me as her son. With so many such things combined, I feel myself to be a boy of this village. Now I have been coming and going to and from this village for about forty-two years."},{"class":"b44","text":" Guru Mahārāj himself was so very affectionate to me; he did not like me to be away from him for even a few hours. Sometimes when I would go to Kolkata, Guru Mahārāj would send a godbrother by a shortcut on the cycle to the bridge to intercept me and call me back. “Call Govinda Mahārāj back, I am not feeling well.” This happened many times. Sometimes, even if there was very important work in Kolkata, he would send someone by cycle with the order, “Bring him back immediately.” But whenever I had to come here to Hapaniya, Guru Mahārāj would always very happily grant me permission. Even if he was not in very good health, his mood would change, and he would become very pleased. He always encouraged me to come to Hapaniya. But so many times when I had to go to Kolkata, he would call me back. Therefore, I am very attached to Hapaniya Dhām."},{"class":"b44","text":" After the manifestation of the Deity, when I was about to go to Hapaniya, sometimes Guru Mahārāj would ask, “Where are you going?” And I would reply, “I am going to my Maṭh.” Guru Mahārāj would enjoy, and laughing he would say, “Oh, Hapaniya is your Maṭh? All right. You may go.” Guru Mahārāj’s mood was very happy if I served the Deity of Rādhā Gopīnāth Jīu. This is why I have become more and more enthusiastic to serve the Deity. Also, many of my godbrothers, especially I can mention Śrīpād Yudhāmanyu Sevā Vikram Prabhu and Śrīpād Aravinda Lochan Sevā Sundar Prabhu, are assisting me very much for the Hapaniya sevā. Many other godbrothers are also helping. Whenever the devotees hear that their contribution is utilised for Hapaniya, their hearts feel peaceful and happy."},{"class":"b44","text":" We enjoy here very feely. When I am in Kolkata, I have heavy responsibilities, and in Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh also I am not worry-free. But in Hapaniya, I feel much peace at heart. I come here weekly or fortnightly. Although I don’t stay very long, I appreciate being here. So now you have come to this very place, Hapaniya, where Guru Mahārāj manifested himself to the world, where all the trees, all the animals, all the men and women—everything is transcendental. Even all the vegetables are transcendental. But it is necessary to eat with a transcendental body. Otherwise, how can we digest?"},{"class":"b51","text":" That day we came here with Guru Mahārāj, a humble meeting was held here in this very place. As shelter, only a tarpaulin was erected above our heads. We sat on the ground, and Guru Mahārāj sat on a chair. He discussed various ślokas. At that time, it was my greatest fortune to hear a special śloka from my Guru Mahārāj for the first time. Guru Mahārāj wanted to inject our hearts with the feeling that we had come to the Holy Abode."},{"class":"b59","text":" yat kiñchit tṛṇa-gulma-kīkaṭa-mukhaṁ goṣṭhe samastaṁ hi tat"},{"class":"b60","text":" sarvānanda-mayaṁ mukunda-dayitaṁ līlānukūlaṁ param"},{"class":"b43","text":" He told us, “Everything here is transcendental and very auspicious. If you can see in this way, you will be benefitted. You will retrieve your transcendental life, and also, you will attain the service of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.” In this way, Guru Mahārāj gave his blessings to us here on that day, and we always remember that.

He was a very successful preacher, and everyone respected him. By the wish of Kṛṣṇa, when Śrīla Guru Mahārāj came out from the Gauḍīya Maṭh, many of the senior devotees also came out at that time, and they started to preach. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj did not join with them, but he helped them. In particular, he helped his godbrothers, such as Śrīpād Jājāvar Mahārāj, Śrīpād Goswāmī Mahārāj, and Śrīpād Keśav Mahārāj, but finally it was his wish to stay alone in this Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh. There is no doubt that his wish was always for preaching. He was always preaching Śrīman Mahāprabhu’s glories and Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur’s glories, and everyone would come to hear from him and receive inspiration. They felt that it was Śrīla Prabhupād himself explaining to them about Kṛṣṇa consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Śrīla Guru Mahārāj started his preaching in Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh, he lived in a hut. It was then his intention that he would preach to those who came to him, but he would no longer go out from the Maṭh to preach. At that time, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj showed us that his health was not so suitable for preaching. But his wish to preach was very strong. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj received some inspiration that it was the desire of Prabhupād Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur and Śrīman Mahāprabhu that this sampradāya would run through him. Many of the disciples of Śrīla Saraswatī Ṭhākur continued their preaching, but mostly it was the earnest desire of Śrīla Saraswatī Ṭhākur that the preceptorial line will run through our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj also was looking for someone to continue that line."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Śrīla Guru Mahārāj gave me the chance to stay at his lotus feet, he received some inspiration: “Perhaps this boy can continue the preceptorial line.” He therefore gave some nourishment to me. I was not so qualified. Actually, I was unqualified, but he tried to make me qualified."},{"class":"b44","text":" I joined in 1947, and presently I noticed that regular periodicals were being published from maybe three or four other Maṭhs. After seven years, through affection and causeless mercy, I had some capacity to publish a magazine, and I also felt very much necessity for our own magazine. I felt that a monthly magazine for our preaching purpose would be very nice, so I approached Śrīla Guru Mahārāj with this proposal."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was very enthusiastic, and I requested that he give an article each month. Also, I approached Śrīpād Madhusūdan Mahārāj, Śrīpād Jājāvar Mahārāj, and others who were capable to contribute articles. At least in every issue, one article must be Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s article, and one I can collect from Śrīla Saraswatī Ṭhākur’s writings. And if Śrīpād Madhusūdan Mahārāj will give one article, then I will get at least three strong articles each month, and in this way the dignity of the paper must be higher than others’ magazines."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was very enthusiastic and said, “This idea is very good. If you can continue, then try to do this.” I then began."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is the teaching of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj that we shall proceed under the guidance of Śrī Guru-Vaiṣṇava, and it is my nature that I always keep the Vaiṣṇavas upon my head. In that way, I considered Śrīpād Madhusūdan Mahārāj to be highly qualified, and if he would take the editor’s position, our magazine would receive universal appreciation. That is, we are living in Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh, and this magazine is for Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh, but our editor is from another Maṭh. Thus, everyone can see that our vision is that we are giving position to those who are really qualified. They will see that we have a broad view. Not only that, but we decided that we shall glorify other Vaiṣṇavas’ characters, and give news of other Vaiṣṇavas’ preaching also. We did that, and furthermore, we published their activities with pictures. We tried to glorify the Mission and character of all the godbrothers who were very affectionately connected with Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. In that way, our <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gauḍīya Darśan</span> had a broad ‘international’ vision."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj agreed and said to me, “If Śrīpād Madhusūdan Mahārāj will accept the position of editor, it will be very good, but you must put your name there as joint editor.” Therefore, Śrīpād Madhusūdan Mahārāj and myself were joint editors, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was the Founder-Āchārya, and Śrīpād Jājāvar Mahārāj and Śrīpād Paramahaṁsa Mahārāj were advisers of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gauḍīya Darśan</span>. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj as far as possible gave an article each month. Śrīpād Madhusūdan Mahārāj, Śrīpād Paramahaṁsa Mahārāj, and others also gave."},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gauḍīya Darśan</span> began as a monthly magazine. For the first few years, the magazine was very strong and ran well, but lastly all the burden for the running of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh came upon my head. I was practically alone, and my time was very short, therefore the magazine became a little weaker later. Also, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj showed his health to be less strong, and it was very difficult for him to give articles regularly. But we tried to continue."},{"class":"b44","text":" We always held a very neutral position. In the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gauḍīya Darśan</span>, glorification to others connected throughout the whole sampradāya was given where it was warranted, also guidelines were given when required. Everyone knew Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was their guide, and they accepted his advice. In this way, <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gauḍīya Darśan</span> gained a high reputation."},{"class":"b44","text":" All the articles were either in Bengali or Sanskrit. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj sometimes composed in Sanskrit, and especially at the beginning of each new year Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would generally compose some Sanskrit ślokas. Also, I must name one good compositor, Khapanaka Prabhu, who helped untiringly for hand-setting the type of the magazine. He was a disciple of Śrīpād Keśav Mahārāj, but with Śrīpād Keśav Mahārāj’s permission he was living with us. Then, like now, many devotees from other Maṭhs would come and stay with us from time to time. They were disciples of other mahārājas, but they would come in order to serve Śrīla Guru Mahārāj."},{"class":"b44","text":" At first, we printed the magazine from an outside commercial press, but after some time I felt the necessity to print from our own press. We then acquired a press and began publishing from it. It was larger than the machine we have here today. Khapanaka Prabhu finally took charge of our printing press. He greatly helped with <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gauḍīya Darśan</span>, but gradually I became exhausted, and actually it was not possible to continue. After fourteen years of monthly printing, we then printed it quarterly, and Khapanaka Prabhu helped then also. We did not stop printing altogether. We printed it as a quarterly publication for a further three years, then finally we printed each year one or two special issues as souvenir editions such as for Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s Vyāsa Pūjā and for Śrī Gaura Pūrṇimā."},{"class":"b44","text":" Actually, the cause of our finally stopping the regular publications was for a very unhappy reason. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj from time to time gave an article. One such article was entitled <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Ratha Yātrāya Śrī Rūpānugānuchintana</span>. This explained what the followers of Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī will think about the Ratha Yātrā."},{"class":"b44","text":" At that time, the Māyāpur Śrī Chaitanya Maṭh started a Ratha Yātrā, but that was very painful for Śrīla Guru Mahārāj because it was offensive to the Rūpānuga-chintadhārā. This is very high siddhānta. Mahāprabhu explained that the meaning of Ratha Yātrā is that Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī takes Kṛṣṇa from Kurukṣetra to Vṛndāvan. But Māyāpur is the birthplace of Mahāprabhu who is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. So from Māyāpur, where are they taking Mahāprabhu? They cannot take Kṛṣṇa out of Vṛndāvan, nor can they take Mahāprabhu out of Māyāpur. This is the thinking of the Rūpānuga followers, and this was explained in that article by Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. However, I did not give Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s name as the author because we knew that some other parties may try to contradict this thinking, and if a conflict will come, I shall face that, but I shall not push Śrīla Guru Mahārāj to the front of any conflict. If I put Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s name and anyone will give any objection, that will be offensive for them, therefore I put the name of one of my godbrothers. We wanted to show everyone what is the proper siddhānta, but in the battlefield we shall not push our Guru to the forefront. I shall go to the battlefield if necessary, but not that I will make my Guru go there."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then from a completely different Maṭh some very ugly criticism and objection came to us through their magazine. In the next issue of our own magazine, we replied to their objections. I was given help with the answer by Śrīpād Dāmodar Mahārāj, a godbrother of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. I did not directly appear in the battlefield, but I gave the front position in the name of Śrīpād Dāmodar Mahārāj, and he also contributed to the reply. He was certainly a good writer, and on the grounds of the principle involved, we tried to fight. But in a very ugly way objection again came from that other section, and it was published in their magazine. They insulted Śrīla Guru Mahārāj directly."},{"class":"b44","text":" Always we had very respectfully given comment in our articles, but they responded with an arrogant personal attack to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, so I went and told them not to criticise in this ugly way."},{"class":"b44","text":" I explained to that party that the article wasn’t even directed at them, but especially at the Māyāpur Maṭh, so why should they come forward and directly try to criticise Śrīla Guru Mahārāj? Anyhow, they did not listen."},{"class":"b44","text":" They said bad things about my Guru, so they expected I would say bad things about their’s, but I could never do that. I tried to show that if anyone wants to criticise, they can, but in an honourable, respectful way, without losing humility. Especially in this case, the article is Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s article, so it must be treated in a respectable way."},{"class":"b44","text":" I told them this many times, but even after hearing from me that this article was from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, they again and again continued to criticise Śrīla Guru Mahārāj in writing in their magazine. I could not give such type of insult to them in our magazine. I know many faults of their Maṭh, but we cannot tell such things and make our <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gauḍīya Darśan</span> into a dustbin."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj asked me what I would do, and I replied to him that I will stop the printing of the magazine rather than walk into that dirty realm of insults. Furthermore, I was exhausted. I wrote most of the articles but put the author’s name as Hari Charaṇ Prabhu, Kṛṣṇa Śaraṇ Prabhu, Kṛṣṇamayī Didi, Śaṅkarī D.D., and others. Sometimes they would write an article but mostly I wrote the articles in theirs and others’ names, and I became exhausted."},{"class":"b44","text":" I was therefore already tired when this ugly criticism came. So, when Śrīla Guru Mahārāj asked me what I would do, I told him I would stop the publication. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj asked them to stop sending their publication to our Maṭh, and until today it is not coming here. Later, I heard that the sannyāsī involved came and apologised to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, but Śrīla Guru Mahārāj expressed to him, “I will not take offence myself because it is not for me, but for our sampradāya. It is an offence to Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī because it is his dhārā that we are continuing, and Mahāprabhu instructed Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī not to take Kṛṣṇa out from Vṛndāvan:"},{"class":"b59","text":" kṛṣṇere bāhira nāhi kariha vraja haite<br />vraja chhāḍi’ kṛṣṇa kabhu nā yāna kāhā̐te"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Chaitanya-charitāmṛta: Antya-līlā, 1.66)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “So, in Māyāpur, where are they trying to take their Ratha Yātrā? My question is, where are they trying to take the Lord? We have no objection to them doing Mahāprabhu’s Ratha Yātrā on another day.

It is like our flag, therefore we cannot stop publishing it. It is alive. You will see that always we have tried to focus on some new light of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s conception. In the previous issues, as much as possible, we have done in this way."},{"class":"b44","text":" Within the last twelve years, many books have been published for our Maṭh in English, Bengali, and many other languages, and there also the devotees can see Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s conception. There is much to read in these books. Now in particular, my wish for this <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gauḍīya Darśan</span> is to present topical subjects and news of all the devotees’ activities here and abroad. For a long time, our preaching has been international."},{"class":"b44","text":" After Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj returned from his successful preaching in the West, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj became very happy and enthusiastic, and he gave much respect to Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj. In Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh every day, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj preached, but he did not go out from the Maṭh except perhaps three or four times yearly. He would go out on special occasions, such as to Śrīpād Mādhav Mahārāj’s Maṭh in Kolkata where yearly they would hold one or two large week-long meetings. Śrīpād Mādhav Mahārāj would eagerly await Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s presence at such meetings. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would go there every year. In addition, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would go to the appearance day meeting of Śrīpād Goswāmī Mahārāj at Śrī Gauḍīya Saṅgha, 23 Doctor’s Lane, Kolkata."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mainly, it was only to Śrīpād Mādhav Mahārāj’s Maṭh and Śrīpād Goswāmī Mahārāj’s Maṭh that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would go to for preaching, but always he preached from his room upstairs in Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was a very enthusiastic preacher, and many devotees had the opportunity to see how enthusiastic he was. Up until 1987, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj continuously preached here, and his preaching continued, though not as fully as before, until a few months before his disappearance in August 1988."},{"class":"b44","text":" Actually, during the whole day, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would preach, but seated at one time he would often preach for two or three hours. The preaching tendency of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was of a very unique type. In March 1986, during his lifetime, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj gave me the full charge of this Maṭh as Āchārya, and we continued to produce publications. From abroad, we also received publications for our Maṭh such as those from Śrīpād Bhakti Sudhīr Goswāmī Mahārāj and others."},{"class":"b44","text":" We continued to publish <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gauḍīya Darśan</span> at least yearly, and after Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s disappearance regular periodicals began from several of our Mission’s branches, including London, South Africa, Australia, and America. I was very enthusiastic to see the arrival of all these English magazines."},{"class":"b44","text":" We are disciples of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, and therefore we are very much enthusiastic to publish books and magazines in order to preach his message and glories. You can see that our preaching tendency is continuously proceeding, so when from the Western world five or six periodicals became manifest, naturally our feelings came that why is this not also possible from Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh? The only cause was a lack of manpower. But if we can publish, then the Mission all over the world will receive some guidelines. Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh is the parent Maṭh of all the Maṭhs in our society, and for their guideline, it is very good if again we can publish regularly <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gauḍīya Darśan</span>. This is what is in the heart of us all here. We are all enthusiastic to again publish <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gauḍīya Darśan</span> because it will be in honour of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, so automatically remembrance of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj will come."},{"class":"b44","text":" In particular, it is my intention that <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Gauḍīya Darśan</span> will be a vehicle to keep devotees around the world connected together. They will get to know what each other are doing and especially they will hear from this central Maṭh, the central source of guidance of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj for us all.

Guru Mahārāj told me, “You look after the devotees and my Deities, and you look after my Mission.” This is my tridaṇḍa sannyās: I will serve his devotees, I will serve his Deities, and I will serve his Mission. And you all are my wealth, of this I have no doubt. I am receiving much energy from the devotees and like a solar battery, whatever light I have, I am using that for the service of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. In this way, I am benefitted, and you are also benefitted."},{"class":"b44","text":" It was the desire of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj that if he can do anything, then first he will do something in London for the satisfaction of his Guru Mahārāj. When Śrīla Prabhupād Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur saw that his other preachers had actually failed to preach successfully in the West, he was very sad, and he requested Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, “If I send you to London for preaching, will you go there?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj replied, “Yes, if it is your order, then I must carry that out, but I think that perhaps I am not the fittest person for that service. I do not understand the manner of the English people, and I do not know what is the proper courtesy there. I am a brāhmaṇ boy, and I do not know how to mix with them. If you wish, I will go, but I think it would be better for your preaching to send Aprākṛta Prabhu [Śrīpād Bhakti Śarāṅga Goswāmī Mahārāj].”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Prabhupād thought, “Yes, what Śrīdhar Mahārāj says is true. He is not accustomed to take prasādam with the mlechchhas, but Aprākṛta Prabhu can do that without any difficulty, and it will be necessary to show them that we do not consider them to be less than us.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" One of the senior godbrothers at that time asked Guru Mahārāj, “Do you know why Śrīla Prabhupād wants you to go to London?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj replied, “Yes, I can guess his reason: so far anyone he has sent to the West, they have returned as a sahib [Western gentleman], but Śrīla Prabhupād is thinking that will not happen in my case.” And that devotee confirmed, “Yes, certainly you will uphold the dress of sannyās and our Mission there, and this is what Prabhupād needs. You will not be converted.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Guru Mahārāj said, “If Prabhupād wants to send me, then I must go. Whether to svarga or naraka, heaven or hell, wherever it may be, I will go there. I have no problem. But what will be more fruitful for his Mission, that is most important, and for this service Aprākṛta Prabhu is more qualified than I.” Aprākṛta Prabhu was sent."},{"class":"b44","text":" These were the outward events, but actually it was not fully the desire of Śrīla Prabhupād that Guru Mahārāj would leave India at that time. Guru Mahārāj’s intelligence was very fine, and he could understand that Śrīla Prabhupād would soon pass away from this world. Guru Mahārāj knew that if he were present at that time, then that would be more happy for Śrīla Prabhupād. And so it was that at the time of his passing, Śrīla Prabhupād called Guru Mahārāj and gave charge of his sampradāya. At that time, his sampradāya was very wide, with sixty-four Maṭhs in India, and his preaching already expanding into the West. His vision, like that of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, was very broad."},{"class":"b44","text":" Once, Śrīla Prabhupād wanted to make a student hostel in London. His idea was that both Indian and Western students would stay there while they were engaged in their studies, and we would try to bring them into the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He said that if necessary then we will supply them with food from the hotel, and that means meat and other things. Hearing this, Guru Mahārāj objected, “If we supply this kind of food to the students, then the prestige of the Mission will be lost.” Prabhupād replied angrily, “I contemplated this question a thousand births ago. <span class=\\"e3\\">Vaikuṇṭha-vṛtti karite habe</span>: we must live in Vaikuṇṭha, not in this material world.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Vaikuṇṭha</span> means <span class=\\"e3\\">vigata kuṇṭha yasmād</span>—where there are no restrictions, where nothing bad can exist, where everything is auspicious; we must direct our consciousness in that direction. We want to do good for others, and whatever is necessary we shall use that. Śrīla A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj Prabhupād also had this mood. Swāmī Mahārāj told me that when he first came to America, having no money, he stayed with a gentleman who had become his friend. This gentleman didn’t prepare his own food, but he would buy it from the local shop. Prabhupād, on the other hand, would prepare chapati and sabji for himself, and would happily take that. His friend asked him to also make some for him, and in exchange he offered to purchase the ingredients, and so Prabhupād would cook for him with his own hand."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj would keep his food in one area of his friend’s fridge, and his friend would keep his food—meat and other things—in another part of that same fridge. When I heard this, I thought it must have been intolerable, and I asked him, “You would still eat your food?” and he replied “What shall I do? I had no other way. I simply considered that Kṛṣṇa is giving me this food, and in this way I am eating.” This was the type of broad mind of Prabhupād A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj, and through that he received much blessing and mercy from Nityānanda Prabhu, from Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, and from Prabhupād Saraswatī Ṭhākur, otherwise how is it possible that one man from India could spread the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra all over the world! And when he returned to India nobody could believe what he had done, and sadly nobody wanted to give reception to him."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, Swāmī Mahārāj wrote to me, “Govinda Mahārāj, I know you have no money, but can you give some shelter at your Maṭh?” and I asked Guru Mahārāj, and he said “What? Nobody is enthusiastic to receive him! You write to him and say that he is always welcome here, and we shall try to give as good a reception as we are able.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" I met them at the train station and with some saṅkīrtan I took them to our Maṭh. Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj stayed in the ‘Blue House’ for one month with two devotees, Achyutānanda and Rāmānuja Prabhus, and every day they met with Guru Mahārāj. It was my good fortune that I was able to arrange a ‘citizens reception’. On the order of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, all the prominent citizens of Nabadwīp gave reception to Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj. At first, they also did not want to attend the meeting, thinking, “Oh he has gone to mlechchha-deś, the countries of the mlechchhas [barbarous cow-killers], so we shall not give any reception.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, Guru Mahārāj told me, “You go and tell them, ‘Śrīdhar Mahārāj will go to that meeting, and Śrīdhar Mahārāj, he is giving that reception.’ Then what will they say? I want to know.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, when I went to Nabadwīp Sanskrit College, which was full of many big paṇḍits, and told them, they said, “Oh, if Śrīdhar Mahārāj is going there, then we will definitely also attend.” Actually, Guru Mahārāj could not attend as he was very sick at that time, but many great brāhmaṇ scholars attended that meeting along with many renowned goswāmīs."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, broad vision is needed, and through that one can preach very easily, but what was done by Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, that is a miracle. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said, “It is a miracle, and we are glad, we are happy, and we are proud.” And hearing this some of Guru Mahārāj’s godbrothers were perplexed, “How is Śrīdhar Mahārāj giving this kind of honour?” and Guru Mahārāj told them, “It is respect to our Guru Mahārāj. He wanted this, and Swāmī Mahārāj, he fulfilled his desire. Then whatever honour we offer to Swāmī Mahārāj that will immediately go to our Guru Mahārāj, and Prabhupād will be happy.” And today when I see your chanting and dancing, I am thinking if Śrīla Prabhupād Saraswatī Ṭhākur was present here, of course he is present in another form, but if physically he were present here, then his full blessings he would give to you all, I have no doubt."},{"class":"b44","text":" At the turn of the last century, Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur predicted that very soon the intelligent men and women from all parts of the world will come to Nabadwīp to enquire where is the birthplace of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, and they will chant His glories and take the Name of Śrī Śachī Nandan, they will cry with His Name and dance, mixing with the devotees of India. And today this has come true by the mercy of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj."},{"class":"b44","text":" When he came here, he had no friends. A few people helped him sometimes, and he was trying to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He was successful, and not only that, he blasted the Western materialistic culture and made many friends, and through that I have come here. When I came, I have thousands of friends, but when he came he was alone—one man."},{"class":"b44","text":" But within was Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, the blessings of his Guru Mahārāj, and the well-wishes of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and a few other disciples of Śrīla Prabhupād Saraswatī Ṭhākur. Now on my tour, I have received much honour and grand reception, and I am thinking this is all the blessings of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj. And here I am seeing the devotees of London dancing and chanting, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Jaya Śachī Nandana, jaya Śachī Nandana, jaya Śachī Nandana</span>”, and where I am I cannot understand. Is it Goloka Vṛndāvan or Nabadwīp?"},{"class":"b44","text":" This is a miracle. This miracle has happened, and I think if it is possible, in the future it will grow more and more. Many devotees of Mahāprabhu, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, and Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj are living and trying to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and through them in the future a glorious preaching movement will be seen. Always we will see that in one wave not everything can be accomplished. Sometimes a very strong wave may come, and some of the troubles in its path will be carried away, but always some will remain standing. But again and again a wave will come, and they will be carried away, and then they will get their real nourishment from that wave. When the flood comes to Nabadwīp, we see that all the trees die, but the flood doesn’t just kill trees, it also provides much fertiliser for the earth, so that within a very short time new growth appears, and soon you cannot see the damage the flood caused."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, everything is possible by the will of Kṛṣṇa, and it was the earnest desire of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj that he will do some service in London. Many times he told us, “My Guru Mahārāj wanted to send me to London. Now all the devotees of the Western world are coming to me, but still I feel some deficiency in my service, and if I can do some sevā in London, I will feel fulfilled.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The devotees wholeheartedly tried to establish that Temple at 49 Dinsdale Road, and it happened, that property was bought, but Kṛṣṇa’s will went the other way, and that place was stolen by Kṛṣṇa. He wants to give us more chance for service: “Again you try to make another Temple for Me.” I am seeing in this way. He does not want us to be lazy. “Once you have done, no doubt, but again you try to serve.” Kṛṣṇa wants to give everyone this inspiration that once again your service has come to you and you try to do that."},{"class":"b51","text":" My feeling is that direct service is wanted from us, and I think very soon the Temple will appear again. It has appeared, but now it is in the form of a rented house, but I think that Guru Gaurāṅga Rādhā Śyāmasundar must be in Their own house. If Śyāmasundar wants to take our service, then it can happen very quickly. Anyhow, our preaching programme must continue. What has been initiated in London, that must not stop. That is my prayer to Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu, Guru Mahārāj, and his devotees.

The qualification is mentioned in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</span> by Śrī Rūpa Goswāmī:"},{"class":"b60","text":" ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo ’tha bhajana-kriyā<br />tato ’nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt tato niṣṭhā ruchis tatah"},{"class":"b50","text":" Until getting a firm position in ruchi, we remain unqualified."},{"class":"b60","text":" kṣāntir avyartha-kālatvaṁ viraktir māna-śūnyatā<br />āśā-bandhaḥ samutkaṇṭhā nāma-gāne sadā ruchiḥ<br />āsaktis tad-guṇākhyāne prītis tad-vasati-sthale<br />ity ādayo ’nubhāvāḥ syur jāta-bhāvāṅkure jane"},{"class":"b43","text":" Therefore, we must say that before attaining anartha-nivṛtti, strong niṣṭhā, and ruchi, if anyone will try to hear such līlā of Kṛṣṇa without a proper guardian, he must fall down into the garbage of sahajiyāism [imitation]."},{"class":"b44","text":" First, the feeling must come through sādhana and sādhu-saṅga as to who is Kṛṣṇa. It is necessary to know about Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa-bhakti, and to proceed in the proper channel. That channel is sādhu-saṅga. In this way, the practitioner will be able to see what is garbage and what is good. He will then gain attachment to Kṛṣṇa, and when that is strong, he will fully leave all mundanity—that is called anartha-nivṛtti. Otherwise, if we hear Kṛṣṇa-līlā, our anarthas will increase, but our Kṛṣṇa consciousness will not."},{"class":"b44","text":" First, with sādhu-saṅga, we will practise through bhajana-kriyā—the nine processes of devotional service. Thus gradually our ruchi will become stronger and our anarthas will go out. All will come through sādhu-saṅga, the association of a qualified sādhu. There are also different gradations of sādhus. If we associate with the madhyam-adhikārī, we will go there to that level. But if we will get the association of one who is an uttam-adhikārī who comes down to the madhyam-adhikārī level, we will go up very quickly. When attachment is very strong, it is called ‘rati’; at that stage to hear the aṣṭa-kālīya-līlā of Kṛṣṇa will help him achieve his higher position. After ruchi, everything will be beautiful. But before that, if we hear aṣṭa-kālīya-līlā, we will go to the garbage of sahajiyāism. This is fact."},{"class":"b44","text":" Anartha-nivṛtti is like having passed the matriculation examinations where all subjects were studied, thereafter entering into a specialised stream of progress, such as into the arts or sciences. So, up until anartha-nivṛtti, one must practise all subjects, then specialise according to his śraddhā and ruchi, otherwise our anarthas will increase. Lust in Sanskrit is called ‘manobhava’, in other words, it is growing in the mind. When the mind is polluted, the body will become polluted."},{"class":"b52","text":" The main principle is attachment to Kṛṣṇa. If that is real, he is qualified to hear from a qualified Guru. This is the general method of our practising procedure."},{"class":"b43","text":" Living with Śrīman Mahāprabhu were so many great followers. He, as an Āchārya, preached Kṛṣṇa consciousness and spread it all over the world. Especially the human section was so enlightened through His divine preaching, but after Mahāprabhu someone had to be the leader—the successor—and He clearly gave that charge to Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī."},{"class":"b44","text":" In a similar way, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur Prabhupād gave the charge to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj by having him sing the ‘power-transmitting’ song <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī Pada</span> in the presence of many of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s senior and junior godbrothers. In this way, Śrīla Saraswatī Ṭhākur gave some hint that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was to continue the line of Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī, and through this they all understood it. After the disappearance of Śrīla Saraswatī Ṭhākur, most of those who required sannyās came to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj to receive it. This is the example in this age."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the time of Śrīman Mahāprabhu, there were many stalwart devotees, and many who were like the Gurus of Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī. Śrī Rāmānanda Rāy, Śrī Svarūp Dāmodar, and others were in the highest position."},{"class":"b44","text":" In Jagannāth Purī, Śrīman Mahāprabhu presented Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī as a student successor in an assembly of His associates. There, many of Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī’s seniors and juniors were present. Mahāprabhu previously had fully blessed him and told the others to also examine him. All were amazed with his qualification and thought it to be only possible through the blessings of Mahāprabhu. Śrīman Mahāprabhu said, “Yes, I have given My full blessings to him, you also give him your blessings.” In this way, they could all understand that Mahāprabhu was arranging for Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī to take the charge of continuing His sampradāya. Later, we can see that with his respectful guidance, the goswāmīs and others happily spent their unique, divine preaching life."},{"class":"b44","text":" From one river many channels will come, but they will not all be named the same. Many channels come from the Ganges, but the Ganges River herself is flowing in one channel. Similarly, Mahāprabhu’s line is flowing through the channel of Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī. Many were maybe more qualifed and senior to Rūpa Goswāmī, but Mahāprabhu gave to him the charge of continuing His sampradāya. For that, all the goswāmīs avoided their own sampradāyas identified by their names. Even though they had many disciples, they directed them all to the line of Śrī Rūpānuga. We can see this in Gaura-līlā, and when we see its manifestation in Kṛṣṇa-līlā, there also the internal service hankering of the whole group of mañjarīs is directed automatically to do the exclusive service of Śrī Rādhā-Govinda under the guidance of Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj gave a very nice example. In a family, both parents are superior to the son, and both are respected by him. The father is the proprietor over the whole family including the mother, but when the son comes to give his respects to them, first he goes to the mother and then to the father. When the father dies, all the property does not go to the mother even though she is in a higher and more respected position, but all goes to the son. From this example, we can understand something about the line of succession.…"},{"class":"b44","text":" How much I can express I cannot say in English, but these are the facts.
