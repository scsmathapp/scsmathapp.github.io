But one thing is certain: the desires of the devotees have been fulfilled very much. I can see it in their faces. And it is reciprocal—you can see it in Śrīla Mahārāj’s face too, how happy he is. We are now in the San Jose, America, part of the tour, and just about halfway done. The energy count will be a bit low, but he is really stimulated each time he sees the devotees. We are all pros at travelling but he hasn’t travelled around the world before, so he’s adjusting accordingly, and he is an expert adjuster. He only needs to be told once, or observe once, and he’ll take it perfectly."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(Q):</span> Have you seen His Divine Grace change during the tour?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(A):</span> Physically he’s put on a bit of weight because the food has been not only tasteful, but nourishing. We Westerners know that living on a Western diet you don’t have to eat much because the food is nourishing and potent. Even small quantities will be nourishing. But the devotees’ desire is to give Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj a try of everything at one time; and Mahārāj’s desire is to fulfil the wishes of the devotees, so he’s trying everything at one time. As a result he’s putting on a bit of weight, but that’s also necessary because he’s doing a lot of work. He’s constantly working, but the work of travelling is a different kind of work than sitting at a desk writing a book or walking around the grounds of Nabadwīp. He’s 63 years old and he leaves me for dead—and I’m 20 years his junior. When we walk he takes giant strides and I have to run just to keep up with him, and everyone thinks I’m quick! When he is on the go he is super fast."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(Q):</span> What were Śrīla Mahārāj’s expectations on this tour?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(A):</span> Actually this tour was organised for one reason only—for His Divine Grace to see his friends and ‘family’: all of his disciples and those who are spiritually related to him in one way or another. That includes all of Śrīla A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj’s disciples also. We are basically all of the same family tree; just different branches, if you like. So he is just coming to see all of his well-wishers and his friends. The reason he felt the need to come to the Western part of the world is because he considered that, whereas in Nabadwīp we can come one-by-one to him from all other parts, for many reasons not all Westerners can go there. Now the economy is in a slump and people can’t afford to go, and those who can afford to go may not like the conditions. Some are too sick to travel, and others can’t travel because of illegal status: Mexicans in America, and others in Australia. They’re all over, trying to make a living. They don’t understand bureaucracy and boundaries, and they cannot go to Nabadwīp and see Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj. Still others can’t travel because the husband can go but the wife can’t, or vice-versa. So Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj felt a need to go to see all of these people and give them some of that mercy that he and only he has. Because, as you can see from the faces of the devotees, all he has to do is just look at them, and they melt like hot butter. So he came for that purpose, just to see the devotees."},{"class":"b44","text":" The preaching side of the mission developed as we progressed. You can’t stop that. People want to ask questions. People want to hear Kṛṣṇa-kathā or they want to know about this or that pastime or what Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj and Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj were really like. And Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj is merciful—he is talking to everybody. He tries to answer everyone’s questions in detail, with such person-to-person intimacy that you’d have to be a very insensitive person not to pick that up. He is really very intimate and very direct. He may talk to your eyes, but actually it is directly to your heart. Wherever people may be from, and from whatever sampradāya or whatever ideas they may have, I’ve not seen one person who’s met him and not felt absolutely satisfied. Whether they are writers or Sanskrit paṇḍits, or whoever they may be or think they may be, Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj satisfies them fully. They keep coming back for more. They can’t get enough!"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(Q):</span> Is it because they are building a temple in Australia that he was inspired to go there?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(A):</span> Not exactly a temple. The intentions originally were to build a temple, then when Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj came he explained that to run a temple means you have to have full-time commitments. You have to think about it in terms of generations. You don’t think about only now. If you’re going to have Deities, then you have to seriously consider how many generations can worship those Deities. They are not just dressed-up dolls. And when the devotees heard this directly from Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj, then their conception changed a little."},{"class":"b44","text":" We will have a nice ashram for the brahmachārīs and visiting sannyāsīs, where those who want to take full-on practices and full doses of the good medicine can go. For those who just want to take medicine in small doses or want to come and get together, then we’ll have a kīrtan hall. We’ll build a nice mandir, where everyone can come. There will be a photo of the Deities of the Nabadwīp Maṭh, and there will be our paramparā photographs. We’ll chant, break bread together—take some prasādam—and everyone will be happy. We can come together in the name of our Guru Mahārāj, Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj, and be happy. What we are doing is taking association, which is what Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj wants. The devotees are together taking association and trying to preach to other people the glories of Mahāprabhu’s message, and trying to get them to see that there is a right path in this difficult world. And if you follow the right path, good."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(Q):</span> We have the experience in San Jose that devotees have become surcharged since Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj arrived. Has this been the experience in every city he’s been to?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(A):</span> Absolutely. Even more so. The enthusiasm I see is a sweetness that comes from the heart. It cannot be disguised. It cannot be manufactured. It just comes from the heart. You can’t stop it. It is like an overflowing river—you try to dam it but it is useless, the stones are going to be ripped apart. If Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj stayed here for one month, all of Los Angeles would be coming here. San Jose would become the second largest city in America. And it is the same in Australia. People started coming out from everywhere like ants out of woodwork, coming from everywhere."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(Q):</span> Devotees that you hadn’t seen for many years?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(A):</span> For donkey’s years! You can’t imagine. Never mind they came; they didn’t want to go home. We suddenly had to find accommodation for all of them. Of course a lot of pre-planning didn’t take off because while a lot of devotees desired to see Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj come, another side of them told them, “It’s not possible, it won’t happen.” They heard this many times. Even up to two or three weeks before the tour was actually going to take off, there was a lot of pessimism that, “As a matter of fact, it might not happen.” But when they heard that Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj was actually on the plane and off to Australia, then it was action-stations: “All men on board; let’s get to work. We’ve got to get this thing together.” And everybody’s ears pricked up, all woke up, dusted off the cobwebs of their spiritual bodies, and just kept coming."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(Q):</span> The question on everyone’s mind is: “Is this the only trip Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj is going to take, or does he feel inspired to make more trips?”"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(A):</span> If anybody thinks this is his only tour, then they really haven’t realised how much the devotees have pleased Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj. Śrīla Mahārāj will travel. He’ll travel probably more now and for longer periods than before. Because now he’s seen and knows how to travel basically by himself, except for the immigration forms which will take him just a short while to do, he won’t be travelling with such a large party next time. Naturally they don’t need an expensive porter like myself to tag along, for a start. And Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj has seen what the devotees can prepare in the way of his personal prasādam and needs. So where we can economise, we will. Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj is very conscious of how the money the devotees give is spent. Every dollar in Nabadwīp he has accounted for. And you’re a tax man, Hāsyapriya Prabhu—you know how difficult it is to keep a constant check. But Śrīla Mahārāj can account for everything right to the last cent."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(Q):</span> What are Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj’s aspirations for the mission?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(A):</span> What Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj would really like more than anything else is constant association among the devotees. That is, forget about your personalities for a moment; forget about your petty differences. Forget about what other sampradāyas and other people are doing. Get on with your devotional life. Get on with meeting with each other. If you can get together for Vaiṣṇava-saṅga as often as possible, that is nourishment for each one of you. That is most important. Chant the glories of the Holy Name, preach to newcomers, and spread the word if you can. But if you can’t, then just come together. A few families can meet; you don’t all have to meet at one time. You can have weekly meetings, and if you can be consistent and meet regularly, that would be nice."},{"class":"b44","text":" I’ll give you a perfect example of that. When the Australian ladies’ committee was collecting money and sending Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj some money on a monthly or quarterly basis, it wasn’t much money, but what really pleased Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj was not the sum that was collected but the fact that these ladies were actually working together. Each time, they took association with each other, and through that they built a bond between each other. And now in Australia—I can truthfully say, and even Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj will support me in this statement—it is very harmonious and very wonderful that the devotees have put all their differences out of the door. Of course, we may occasionally fight with each other, but generally the family in which there are never any fights is a family that is childless. In our family we have happy fights. But we also have happier times when we have a meeting and prasādam together once a week. We have a simple chanting-hall where we’re getting together."},{"class":"b44","text":" You Americans are the masters for marketing anything. Look what you did with the message of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj. No doubt he was a great personality. He came here, and as Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj always says, although he wasn’t the most successful businessman, in the business of Kṛṣṇa consciousness he was the master, and he had the best of everything. Americans came out from everywhere and didn’t know anything about Gauḍīya–Vaiṣṇavism, but they were the best marketers. You can promote the message and that’s what we need now. We need people to go out and say, “Yes, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is still alive.” The real sweetness of Kṛṣṇa’s message is still available, and not just at the airports, but it is available at any time that you desire it. Here in America it is available at the San Jose temple; at the Miami branch of the Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh; in New York, and elsewhere. It is available. It may not be absolutely known to everybody, though, so that’s the job for us now: to let other people know. This is what our various newsletters around the world are doing."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(Q):</span> What can we do to attract Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj to return?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(A):</span> That’s what we’re doing now. I can really only answer for Australia in a definite way, and for others I can only give you glancing preview. In Australia we are definitely trying to attract Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj by getting some land immediately. Right now I’m constantly getting calls from the devotees, asking me to find out what kind of land Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj wants. Land is much more available there, and certainly at a cheaper price than here, but still the endeavour to do so is available everywhere. On his next trip Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj will go to Malaysia, Mauritius, and South Africa—particularly Mauritius, which he has promised to go to for many years. And after that tour, when he returns to Australia he will see a mandir, hall and quarters that we’re going to build for him, and then he can visit Australia on a regular basis."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(Q):</span> You’re talking about a second tour. What will be the tentative itinerary for the second tour of America?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(A):</span> San Jose, definitely next year. Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj has promised. In Maui, one gentleman has offered Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj 55 acres of land, and the man is not even a disciple—yet another example of our saying about people coming out of the woodwork. There is one man who is hungry for some sort of service to Kṛṣṇa. And somebody else whose desire was not true would have grabbed it immediately, but Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj always looks at the devotees’ needs, and he says, “I shall come back and then we can talk.” And if the gentleman still feels the same, which I’m certain he will, then something will develop on the island of Maui, and Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj has promised them also that he will come back for two or three weeks."},{"class":"b44","text":" He has mentioned to me privately that he would like to come to San Jose again, because our time here is not sufficient. We’re here for only seven days, and we’re visiting two places within 50 kilometres of each other. Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj wants to see other parts of America, particularly New York—he’s promised Śrīpād Giri Mahārāj that sometime he would like to go there to see the ‘Big Apple,’ as he calls it."},{"class":"b44","text":" Also, many devotees want to take initiation from Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj and time is not sufficient to initiate them all. Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj shall do what he can now, but the desire to give connection and mercy is there constantly. He must come back. But you can make it more inviting for him by saying, “Well Mahārāj, we’re getting a temple together. We’re meeting every week and doing some service.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Everybody wants to get connection—and Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj is giving that easily; but not everybody is coming and saying, “Please engage me in service.” I do hear it from some, quietly, but not many are coming up and saying, “Please engage me in service.” But if everyone comes up and receives connection and then engages in service, automatically you will have a temple here, and it will probably be the crowning jewel of the Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh’s overseas branches."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj has special affection for many devotees, but great and special affection for devotees connected to the San Jose Maṭh because despite all of their trials, tribulations, and difficult circumstances they still go ahead and do their service, and do their service also to the central Maṭh in Nabadwīp. That is another thing people mustn’t forget. We do our service for our local Maṭh, but we must also do our service for the centre. Devotees should go there whenever possible. Everybody should try to go and stay there for six months and spend some time. Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj likes to engage the Westerners in service there. They are happy to be there and they are doing good service. They are doing things which are full of austerities for them in their Westerners’ bodies, but they’re doing it very happily. And Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj feels comfortable when the Westerners are at the Maṭh. He feels that his family is all there. If it is only the Indians and Bengalis, then he feels that only half of his children are there. But when all the Westerners are there, he feels happy; then he’s jolly."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(Q):</span> Is there an open invitation for all the devotees to visit Nabadwīp and spend time there?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(A):</span> I can say that absolutely wherever he goes Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj continuously makes an open invitation to everyone. You can go there and be his guest if you like, or if you are his disciple, you can go to your father’s house happily. He will very happily nourish you in any way he can, because he likes to serve."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(Q):</span> On Mahārāj’s next tour, what can we do to improve things for his convenience?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(A):</span> In an organisational sense, I can’t see how you could improve things. You are doing the best within the shortest period of time. What is necessary is that we want to try and give him maximum exposure to the devotees and the general public in the minimum amount of time."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(Q):</span> Is there anything else you’d like to express to the devotees world-wide when we publish this interview?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">(A):</span> I would like them to know how grateful I am to everyone who wrote to me with all their suggestions, and to all for their assistance and their planning. It is not a one-man show—I didn’t do this by myself. Through the grace of Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj, and through the kindness of Śrīpād Sāgar Mahārāj who asked me to take charge of this particular part of the tour in planning, I’m just another cog in the wheel. The only reason the wheel has turned around very nicely without any disruption is because of everybody everywhere. And that means from the person who delivers our Maṭh’s publications, to the chief cook making a buffet meal for all of us—everybody has assisted in every way possible. Everyone has found some engagement, some way to serve, and they are serving the centre as the servant of the servant of the servant. That has been the pleasing thing, to know that we have such a big family and they are participating all over the world."},{"class":"b44","text":" I tell you, any devotee who wants to go any place in the world now, once we have our mission’s branches properly established—wherever they go they will find their brothers, sisters, etc. They are never going to feel alone ever again. Once Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj has finished this tour and established everything nicely, no devotee will be able to say that he’s alone. And if he says he’s alone, then he is not seeing very clearly, because all around him is his family—everywhere. All he needs to do is get in contact with them in the same kind of service mood as you’ve all shown in the presence of Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj."},{"class":"b52","text":" Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj loves every one of us, and if the devotees can come together as a loving, serving family, then a beautiful thing will happen. Whenever strangers will see Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj’s disciples they will say, “There go those people. They are Govinda Mahārāj’s disciples. They are so harmonious and so loving to each other. They are a nice bunch. We should get to know these people,” instead of, “There goes such and such person’s disciples. All they’re doing is just gossiping and speculating, and back-stabbing each other the first chance they get.” We don’t want to hear such things, for it burns our ears. All we want to hear are sweet things. “There goes Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s disciple; there goes Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj’s disciple. They are so nice, and so loving to each other. Let’s try to arrange something with them so that we can gain their association.”"}]},{"title":"Universal Grace","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b35","text":" All glory to Śrī Guru and Śrī Gaurāṅga"},{"class":"b47","text":" Universal Grace"},{"class":"b35","text":" The following address was given<br />at the Lauden Nelson Center,<br />in Santa Cruz, California, on June 30, 1992<br />by<br />His Divine Grace<br />Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj"},{"class":"b60","text":" oṁ ajñāna-timirāndhasya<br />jñānāñjana-śalākayā<br />chakṣur unmīlitam yena<br />tasmai śrī-gurave namaḥ"},{"class":"b60","text":" vāñchā-kalpatarubhyas’cha<br />kṛpā-sindhubhya eva cha<br />patitānāṁ pāvanebhyo<br />vaiṣṇavebhyo namo namaḥ"},{"class":"b60","text":" namo mahā-vadānyāya<br />kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te<br />kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa chaitanya-<br />nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ"},{"class":"b43","text":" Respected devotees, my dear godbrothers and sisters, honourable gentlemen and ladies, by your mercy I have come here for meeting with you all, and I want to spend some time with you to speak about Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Previously, a great general in the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Śrīla A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Prabhupād, felt a great necessity to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness, especially in the Western world. He could not wait to do that, and as soon as possible he tried to come. And he came alone. But what is that feeling he had? Actually what did he want to do, and why? My connection also is with that consciousness, and I can say it is the topmost necessity for the conditioned souls. One who can understand this cannot tolerate living without giving something of that consciousness. That was Śrīla Prabhupād’s position. He was always feeling compassion for the conditioned souls who are suffering so much in this mundane world. Conditioned souls cannot understand what is good for their real life, their eternal life. That feeling brought him to the West. No doubt, his Gurudev, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur, ordered him to preach in the West, but Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur gave that order to all the devotees also."},{"class":"b44","text":" The feeling to do good for others was deeply in the heart of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj.

With a full, good heart, he could not tolerate the deficiency of knowledge and Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the jīva-souls, and he tried as soon as possible to come to the West. He tried so hard to give Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and during the first year he suffered in many ways, but his eagerness and his deep feelings gave success to his preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" He started alone, but—eko ‘haṁ bahu syām—”I, the One, became many.” This is an aphorism of the Upaniṣads. Bhagavān, the Supreme Lord, was alone first and then He became many, and with His heart of love He manifested Himself in millions of forms. Similarly, Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, whose heart was filled with divine love, wanted to distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness. His feeling was that it was an extreme necessity for the conditioned souls, and if they didn’t get it, what would they take? And in which way would they live?"},{"class":"b44","text":" Actually he was very disturbed and could not understand why the conditioned souls were running around in the illusory environment.

I have received mercy from you, therefore I can come. ‘Mercy’ means your affection. Affection has attracted me to meet with you, and this affection has grown through Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise, I live in India and you live in America—we live so far apart. But attachment, attraction and affection have all grown through Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and thus I have a chance to come here and meet with you. What can I give to you? You have all material things. But Kṛṣṇa consciousness has no end. We can only start and we can only proceed, but we will find that there is no end. It is infinite. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is infinite."},{"class":"b44","text":" There are several kinds of relationships in service to Kṛṣṇa, and feelings are also infinite there. Our connection with the Infinite is always giving us that infinite position. And our service mood will also always work infinitely in that infinite world. That is Goloka Vṛndāvan. Some may consider the ultimate plane to be Paravyoma or Vaikuṇṭha, but the underlying necessity is to practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that is our life’s goal. Our real form is transcendental, not destructible, and there is much possibility to get a position in the service World. We have that type of possibility and form. If, in any way, any auspicious soul can connect us with that transcendental world, we will get everything there. This feeling was in the heart of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj. He tried in many ways to begin his mission in India, but lastly he thought, “My place is in the West, and I can try to do something there.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" All religions are always showing us something.

But actually religion is not for India and not for America; religion is for the jīva-soul. Jīva-souls have permanent existence which is thinking, feeling, and willing, and jīva-souls are eternal. They have the Religion of service to Kṛṣṇa, their Lord, and service to the transcendental plane. There we find all happiness, all ecstasy, all beauty, charm, and divine love. Whatever we want in this mundane world within our conditioned position—beyond that, in the transcendental world, that divine love is always waiting for us, waiting to embrace us. That is the actual position, and one who can understand this cannot live without giving that gift to others. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" Once we wake up and get connected with that consciousness, we can never leave it. We must proceed stage after stage up to Vraja Dhām, Goloka Vṛndāvan. That is the Religion of all the jīva-souls."},{"class":"b44","text":" Many auspicious mahātmās, or great religious teachers, come from time to time, and their goal is to try to take us up over this illusory environment. Some religions want to take us to heaven, some religions want to take us to Brahmaloka, some want to take us to Vaikuṇṭhaloka—all of them want to take us to a higher level. But ultimately all the scriptures and the very intimate servitors of Kṛṣṇa come down into this mundane world to show us our highest life’s goal, which is service to our divine lover, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. One who has that feeling will surely give us connection with Kṛṣṇaloka. That is the nature of the sādhu. Sādhus do not want to enjoy anything, but they are always trying to give enjoyment to others—not mundane enjoyment, but transcendental joyfulness, happiness, ecstasy. The description of Kṛṣṇaloka or Goloka Vṛndāvan is very nicely given in Brahma-saṁhitā, Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, and other scriptures that are trying to give divine knowledge to us and trying to make us qualified servitors in that divine plane."},{"class":"b44","text":" So I have come to meet with you all not for any mundane enjoyment or for giving or taking anything mundane. You are my godbrothers, godsisters, and spiritual relatives."},{"class":"b44","text":" Actually the ātmā, the soul, is coming from a vast power, and we are part of that. In that way, we are all relatives. When a particular sādhu came from India and addressed the people, “Brothers and sisters of America,” everybody was charmed to hear it. We really are all brothers and sisters related with each other in a higher way, and everybody has some existence with a relationship to each other in their eternal form—that is chaitanya-jīvātma—and everybody has a service relationship with our divine lover, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In that way we are all related. We must try to help each other to progress in the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and then we will easily proceed to our destination. That is the advice of the scriptures."},{"class":"b44","text":" In this way, I need your association. You are giving me much affection, but not for mundane enjoyment, and not for taking or giving something mundane. By your association perhaps I can give some hope to you all to try to proceed to your destination. I can say what is your own property, what is the wealth of your soul. I must try to help you, and you also can give me hope and encouragement for that transcendental service. That is my hope. You have many things in this mundane world, but the real necessity is the mood of practising Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That has no end, and it is increasing in an ever more beautiful way. With heartfelt energy you please try to proceed, and you can preach this Kṛṣṇa consciousness to others for their benefit. I shall try to help in that way, and if you have any questions about Kṛṣṇa consciousness, I will try to give an answer."},{"class":"b44","text":" My English is very poor, so I cannot give a formal lecture. It is very difficult for me to give that. But it is very easy for me to give answers about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I have received some mercy from my Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, and for a long time I am connected with their movement. Also, it is my duty to everybody. If I can help you to feel satisfied in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then I must feel satisfaction in my service.

But it is also sometimes a factor of time as to when Kṛṣṇa will accept that devotee or how much time He will spend for him. But we should not feel hopeless because of that. When the time actually comes we shall surely understand. It may be a very short time—just in front of us— or maybe a long, long time. But what is time? Maybe a few births can also come and go in that time, but that is also a very meagre thing. In relation to infinite time it is most insignificant. From Kṛṣṇa we get our hope, and this is a one hundred percent assurance. But while we are waiting for that position of liberation from this mundane environment, and when we want to proceed to our destination, this is when the association of Kṛṣṇa’s devotees will be most helpful. Such association can give relief and nourishment to our mind and soul."},{"class":"b44","text":" Lord Kapiladev told His mother, Devahuti, “Mother, please don’t worry.

Through their association your practising life will happily progress.” That means with śravaṇam, kīrtanam, vandanam, etc. The Lord says, “If you hear from My servitors about Me, and in their association you happily chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra and My glories, you will get much nourishment for your practising spiritual life.

If we read those books, we will get much strength and nourishment, and we can proceed very happily to our destination."},{"class":"b44","text":" So if a living sādhu is not in front of me, I must try to read his books.

It is not for other ages. In Kali-yuga it gives a very good chance to the conditioned souls. Kṛṣṇa Himself appears in His Name, in the form of the mahāmantra. The Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra and Kṛṣṇa are nondifferent. All the scriptures teach this to us."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Name and the Person are the same. They are both transcendental and eternal.

Over the years, many of us have developed what might be considered not very good habits, such as putting pictures of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa on the wall without offering any worship to Them; saying “Haribol” without any reverence, etc. Should we in the West now try to make a change in our attitude?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj:</span> If Śrīla Prabhupād would have immediately given what he wanted to establish in the West, everyone would not have been able to digest it. In a very broad way, Śrīla Prabhupād tried to distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the West. He selected a process when he gave Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and he gave some conditions. “You want to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa? Will you follow four directives?” (No gambling; no intoxication; no illicit sex; and no meat eating) “Yes.” So he gave you the mantra and instructed, “You must chant sixteen rounds, and you must follow the four directives. If you want to live the life of a brahmachārī you can stay in the Maṭh, or if you like you can stay in the Maṭh in gṛhastha form.” That chance he also gave. He knew the Western world’s activities, in which way it was going, and the West and India are not the same. Indian culture and Western culture are very different. In India, in meetings, ladies are always seated on one side, and gents on the other side. But it is not like that in the West. Here in America, and in Australia, I see everywhere so many ladies driving cars—not only cars, but big, big trucks as well. Easily they are driving, and with a very free mind. They have a culture in which everybody is giving respect to everybody. I have seen it in Australia especially. We were standing in the road, and a lady was going by in a car very fast. Although she did not know us, and we did not know her, still she gave us some attention and some honour."},{"class":"b44","text":" Anyway, the cultures of India and the United States are not the same, also the lifestyles are not the same. Prabhupād considered: “If I try to give them the Indian way, they will not be able to take it.” So he gave some method whereby you must follow the four directives. The four prohibited acts here are very common. Everybody is drinking liquor. Maybe those who have some disease don’t, but everybody else does. Father, mother, wife, sons, and daughters—all are drinking something at the same dinner table. And for mixing of the sexes, everybody has freedom; they can mix almost without restriction. There is so much freedom in the West, and when Prabhupād saw that, he decided to establish the four directives. He thought, “If they can follow these, they will become advanced in the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Regarding the sixteen rounds, he considered: “They do not know about Kṛṣṇa-nām, Hari-nām.” So he said, “You first practise chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare / Hare Rāma Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. Practise! Practise! Then, you will understand what is behind that.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" When I first heard that mantra in my youth, I was very small, only twelve years old at that time. I did not know Sanskrit, but the mantra is manifest in the Sanskrit language. Brāhmaṇs may give mantras for meditation, but if asked the meaning of the mantra, they generally reply, “It is not necessary to know. Just meditate on what I have told you, and the mantra will reveal the meaning in your heart.” That was their advice. And it is true for the mahāmantra that it is transcendental, and He will be revealed in our hearts."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj advised every one, “Chanting sixteen rounds daily is the minimum amount of chanting. But in this way the habit will come to you to chant. First you will get that habit, then your practising life will become very easy. And when the searching tendency grows in your heart, you must try to search out what it is, and you will receive help from the upper level. That is the main process.” Prabhupād did not always tell everything to everybody, but he did ask everyone, “Will you follow the four directives?” “Yes, sir.” “You will chant Hare Kṛṣṇa?” “Yes.” “Very nice. Now here—take these beads and go on chanting sixteen rounds daily.” In this way he engaged everyone."},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa is very merciful. He does not just look at the devotee’s external activities. Kṛṣṇa wants the heart of the devotee. He wants to see if there is love and affection along with the service for Him. Kṛṣṇa wants that. He is not looking to see if you are American or you are Indian. Kṛṣṇa does not want to know where you were born in this world. Kṛṣṇa only wants your love, your affection, and your attachment for Him with full faith and sincerity. And wherever He finds it, Kṛṣṇa will give His mercy. But it is not always coming through the practising process. The practising process will only help us. If I say, “Haribol, Haribol,” an outsider will also see me, and he will imitate, saying “Haribol.” In that way, some saṁskāra (acquired tendency or notion) will come to them."},{"class":"b44","text":" There is practically no comparison between Western and Eastern saṁskāra, but you have the right to practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and they have the right to practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Prabhupād tried to give that to the Western world."},{"class":"b44","text":" There are many differences we see between Indian and Western cultures. I remember one devotee who was connected with Kṛṣṇa consciousness for fifteen years. He is a disciple of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj. When he met with me in Nabadwīp, he had a bag with him and he requested, “Mahārāj, I shall go to Calcutta for three or four days; can I keep my bag in your room?” I told him, “Yes, Prabhu, you can.” So he kept his bag in my room. I left, and I did not see where he put it. Then when I came back, I saw that he had placed it near the door. I noticed one pair of big shoes just inside his bag. Suddenly it came in my mind, “Is there anything holy inside the bag?” So I took out the shoes and I saw the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, and the Bhagavad-gītā also. Then I became puzzled, and I took it this way: I apologised to Kṛṣṇa, “He does not know what is what. You please forgive his offences, and forgive my offence for not preventing this from happening.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" After four or five days that boy came back, and I said to him, “Oh Prabhu, what have you done? You kept your shoes upon the Bhāgavatam and Gītā. That is very bad.” But he replied, “No, Mahārāj, I have not kept my shoes in my bag. Somebody else put them there.” I said, “No, Prabhu, nobody else is coming in my room, only you came. Nobody touches anything in my room. Everything is kept here in a very methodical way. Only I know what is where, and nobody ever touches anything. You have done this.” But he very strongly denied it, “No, Mahārāj, I could not have done that. I have been practising Kṛṣṇa consciousness for fifteen years. I know what is what. I could never do that!” Lastly, because he has so much affection for me, and he thought I was angry with him, he began to cry. While he was crying, I embraced him."},{"class":"b44","text":" I told him, “Prabhu, I believe you have not done it. You are saying that you have not done it, and I believe you. Now be happy! Don’t cry.” Hearing this, he was very happy and stopped crying. He then wanted to show his respect and affection for me, so he fell down to offer daṇḍavat praṇāms, full daṇḍavats. But at that time he was chanting on his beads. So where would he keep his beads? He is expert—fifteen years in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But immediately he put his chanting beads on top of his shoes! Therefore by this example you can understand what is saṁskāra."},{"class":"b44","text":" He put his beads right on top of the big, big shoes. He was thinking, “This is the highest place. If I put them on the ground, that is offensive, so some higher place is necessary.” Seeing that his shoes were higher, he put his beads there."},{"class":"b44","text":" I told him, “Oh Prabhu, what have you done? Don’t do this.” Then he was very upset. And he said, “Oh Mahārāj, I am a mleccha. Forgive my offences. I do not know what is what. Please forgive my offences.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" Then again I embraced him and told him, “Who am I? Kṛṣṇa will surely forgive you. Kṛṣṇa knows what is what. You have much affection for Kṛṣṇa consciousness; that is your qualification, and that is the highest qualification. Kṛṣṇa is not seeing where you are putting the tulasī beads, but I must see, because I am cultured by Indian philosophy. But Indian philosophy or Western philosophy will not give liberation, and they will not give devotion. Actual devotion and liberation will come from the heart. And that heart you have. So don’t worry, Prabhu.” Then I embraced him again and I told him one śloka from the scriptures:"},{"class":"b59","text":" murkho vadati viṣṇāya<br />dhīro vadati viṣṇave<br />ubhayos tu samam puṇyaṁ<br />bhāvagrāhi janārdanaḥ"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Chaitanya-bhāgavat: Adi-khaṇḍa, 11.108)"},{"class":"b43","text":" Kṛṣṇa is enjoying the mood of devotion, and not anything of this mundane plane. And there are two processes of practising life. One type completely tries to follow the directives of the Vedas, but does not know their actual meaning.

But one who has no mood of devotion can do anything, however holy it may appear, but Kṛṣṇa will not recognise it."},{"class":"b44","text":" I explained the meaning of that śloka to him, and he was very happy. I also told him, “Never do this again. It is offensive, but not for you. It is offensive for me; that is, I know it is not good. You do not know. Therefore Kṛṣṇa will forgive you, but He will not forgive me if I allow it. Kṛṣṇa knows that I am familiar with, and accustomed to, the proper habits from my childhood, but you are not habituated in this way.

In that way you are very innocent.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Sometimes a small baby passes stool on his mother’s lap while she is eating, but the mother does not cast the baby off her lap.

With freedom the jīvas can finish their material existence through divine service to Kṛṣṇa. And for that He gives them freedom. But He is expecting service, expecting love. He has much love, and He wants to reciprocate with the jīva-souls. Therefore Kṛṣṇa will not see any bad in us. We just need the heart-felt desire to serve Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa will see only that."},{"class":"b51","text":" We must try to follow some rules and regulations, and that is good, but it is not the all-essential thing.

He did not know how to perform tapasyā (penance) and he did not know what is what, but because his mother told him, “Just try to meditate on Nārāyaṇ,” he tried to do that with faith and determination. He became absorbed in thinking, “I must try to satisfy Nārāyaṇ.” In that way he tried to meditate, and Nārāyaṇ, who has His existence within everybody’s heart, immediately understood what Dhruva wanted. At that time He told Nārad Muni, “Nārad, this boy wants My connection, but it is only possible through the proper channel, and you are the proper channel for him.” That is Disciplic Succession; we consider this the proper channel. The mantra comes down through heart-to-heart transmission, and in that way it is manifest in the heart of a devotee. Some special mercy may always be available, and somebody can get that. Still, it is also necessary to accept a direct connection with the transcendental world, and that is coming in the line of disciplic succession. This is the advice of the scriptures. So Nārāyaṇ said to Nārad, “Go and initiate him with the mantra.” Therefore Nārad initiated Dhruva Mahārāj, and through that mantra Dhruva received the darśan (he beheld the divine form) of Nārāyaṇ."},{"class":"b44","text":" Nārāyaṇ does not want to break His own rule.

I do not know who is living in this party, and who is living in that party, who is living in India, and who is living in America. I have no differentiating mind. We want to practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness—this is what we have received from Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur. This is our preceptorial line. In that line, I am so fortunate to have two Gurus, and many others also. But two are super-instructors and Gurus, and I am trying to follow their directives and their process. I am preaching this to my friends and to whoever has some faith in me. My process is to preach, and not to say that this Prabhu or that person is better."},{"class":"b44","text":" The process is humility, tolerance, and giving honour to others. This process was given by Mahāprabhu. You know that śloka, the third śloka of the Śikṣāṣṭakam. The proper chanting qualification is that you must be humble—humility must be your property; you must be tolerant, and you must give all honour to others. Through these three things, one can easily avoid Vaiṣṇava-aparādh. Vaiṣṇava-aparādh is the greatest obstruction to chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra. The mahāmantra is coming from the upper level, and through the Vaiṣṇavas it is coming down. Through the Pañcha Tattva—Śrī Kṛṣṇa Chaitanya, Prabhu Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita , Śrī Gadādhar, and Śrīvās Ṭhākur—the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra is distributed in this mundane world. But if you make any offence to Them, the mahāmantra will not be happy with you, and He will not manifest Himself in your heart. Mahāprabhu said we must avoid Vaiṣṇava-aparādh, and also the other nine kinds of offences to Hari-nām. Very easily we can avoid them."},{"class":"b44","text":" What is necessary, nose or breath? If we have no nose, it may be tolerable, but if we cannot breathe we shall die. What is our life? Our life is for practising Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is what we need. For every jīva-soul, the most important thing is that we need to practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness. What our identification is—that is not so important. Whether someone is Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s disciple or Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj’s disciple is not so important."},{"class":"b44","text":" The important thing is we need to practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness under the guidance of a good Vaiṣṇava who has the aforementioned three qualifications; who has developed real feelings about Kṛṣṇa consciousness; and who is expert at giving us transcendental knowledge about Śrī Kṛṣṇa. We must invite his association into our life. We will always try to get good association. A devotee may be in ISKCON, or he may be in Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s Maṭhs, but what is important for me is sādhu-saṅga , and wherever there is a sādhu, I shall try to get his association. A sādhu will not differentiate between this camp or that camp. He will differentiate between the levels of devotion. Wherever there is pure devotion, he will be attracted there."},{"class":"b44","text":" My business is like that. I want to make everybody my friend and well-wisher, not my enemy. This has always been my tendency since childhood. I always bow down to everybody. I shall not make any offence to any Vaiṣṇava."},{"class":"b44","text":" Even if a devotee is not in our sampradāya—he may be in the Rāmānuja sampradāya or any other Vaiṣṇava sampradāya—but I am afraid to make any offence to him."},{"class":"b44","text":" There is no question about ISKCON. If anybody has that type of feeling, that party spirit, then I must ask him to leave that feeling. Avoid that type of mentality, and come and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra which was given by Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj, or given by Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj. They did not want to make a sectarian party, so why are we eager to make a party? We want to harmonise with everything. So we can easily harmonise both of their societies."},{"class":"b44","text":" But ‘society’ means many people. People have many faults, many difficulties. The ego is the worst enemy for everybody. We must avoid false ego. What will I lose if I give honour to others? If I am humble and tolerant, all good qualities will come to me. Mahāprabhu said that with this qualification we shall try to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and then we will gain real feeling for that transcendental Hari-nām mahāmantra. The Holy Name is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa, so it is a good practice not to think in the line of party spirit. It is our life’s goal to practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness without offence to Hari-nām; and wherever that is possible, we are slaves of that place."},{"class":"b44","text":" What is our life’s goal? And what am I here for? If I can do something good for others, then I shall feel that my mission is successful. Otherwise, so much money is being spent, and that money came through the energy of the devotees. I shall not be happy if my mission is not successful. And what is my mission? To meet with my friends and their families. And if I get the chance to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then I shall try to preach in an independent way. That is my mood. I shall be very happy if by my association anybody will feel inspired to proceed in the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Even if it is only one man, then still I shall be very happy. Then I will feel that my mission is successful."},{"class":"b44","text":" We all need to practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and whichever way it is possible, we shall try to follow in that line. Many missions are going in the line of party spirit. Sometimes they are doing good, and sometimes they are doing many wrong things. Actually, we have no line in that sense. But what is our life’s goal—we must first keep that, and then without disturbance to the environment and others, we can proceed. It is necessary to see the goal. And if it is possible to make everything harmonious, then that is very good. That will give us more inspiration, and that will give us more attachment and attraction for each other. That would be very good, but actually it is very difficult to do. I can control my own ego, and maybe I can control a few of my friends’ egos, but I cannot control everybody’s ego. And because our ego is our worst enemy, it is questionable how much total harmony is possible."},{"class":"b44","text":" Another consideration is that Kṛṣṇa does not want to give prema-bhakti to just anybody. Kṛṣṇa wants to give mukti, liberation, but He bhakti, devotion, indiscriminately. Even though His devotee is freely distributing the seeds of bhakti, Kṛṣṇa sometimes tries to avoid that because He becomes controlled by one who becomes His devotee."},{"class":"b44","text":" So a reaction may come to the mind of the general seeker in such a way that he may leave Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But we must go on practising Kṛṣṇa consciousness even though Kṛṣṇa may not want to give it, because if a devotee wants to give it, then Kṛṣṇa cannot do anything. However, when the devotee is no longer present, Kṛṣṇa may try to hide it. Kṛṣṇa is not foolish! Kṛṣṇa may sometimes try to avoid freely giving out consciousness of Him. That is the nature of spiritual transactions."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the scriptures it is said, muktiṁ dadāti karhichit sma na bhakti-yogaṁ. This is the reason why there is some disturbance coming in every society. When a devotee wants to leave, Kṛṣṇa feels that He has no right to check that. Devotees randomly distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but after that, one must practise. The devotee who gave you the seed will not come and practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness for you. Then in the practitioner’s life there may be some fault, and Kṛṣṇa may be avoiding him. Faults are coming, and the practitioners are going away from the track. Then the examination is failed, and one is disqualified. When boys run in a race, everyone has a lane to stay in. And if anyone goes out of his own lane, he is disqualified. But with the proper help from the genuine Vaiṣṇavas, we will always remain on the right path."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj always tried to harmonise everything. The whole Gauḍīya Mission, and the heads of other missions, came to him from time to time and took advice from him—even his enemy group. ‘Enemy’ means those who were abusing him. On one occasion one person who was the head of an opposition camp, came to see Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, and Guru Mahārāj asked him, “Why are you coming to see me? You are living in an opposite camp.” And that person replied, “Mahārāj, you are not a party man. Your strong common sense, super intelligence, and disinterested (detached) nature always attract me and this is why I am coming to see you. Talking with you, I always feel very happy. That is why I am coming to you.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" I am a disciple of that Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, and I have also grown with that consciousness. I am feeling everybody is my friend. And if they are not my friend, then I want to make them my friend. I do not want to have any enemies."},{"class":"b52","text":" I have many friends in the ISKCON society, and some of them are very good friends. In Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s godbrothers’ societies and my own godbrothers’ societies, many devotees are very affectionate to me, and actually I am living by their mercy. They are affectionate and merciful, and when I am getting their affection and mercy, I am thinking that my practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness must go on in a happy way. So, following in the footsteps of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, I am trying to harmonise with everything. That is my mood."}]},{"title":"Demolishing Pillars of Ego","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b35","text":" All glory to Śrī Guru and Śrī Gaurāṅga"},{"class":"b47","text":" Demolishing Pillars of Ego"},{"class":"b35","text":" A Lecture given on the Island of Maui, Hawaii, by<br />His Divine Grace<br />Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj"},{"class":"b43","text":" Why have I come here to the West?

We are so fortunate no doubt, but what seed have they given to us? And have we planted it properly or not? Is it showing its form and glory or not? It is present in our heart, but it is necessary to realise how much it is showing itself.

My father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc. were all gurus. Being born in such a family I know what is the position of a Guru. Therefore I was not eager to take the position of Guru, and I did not want to play or pretend with others in such matters—that is not my nature.

Now I am trying to follow the directives of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, and I am also telling those directives to my friends and to my disciples."},{"class":"b44","text":" If I am humble, I can say to a boy, “You must be humble!” But if I am not humble, then in which way will he learn humility?

We cannot conceive of how broad-hearted he was."},{"class":"b44","text":" One day the following incident happened. Śrīla Prabhupād Saraswatī"},{"class":"b44","text":" Ṭhākur wanted to establish a centre in London. He proposed that a student hostel be constructed where Indians and foreigners can stay. There would then be some chance to give them some nourishment, and some chance to preach to them about Kṛṣṇa consciousness in a very sober way. By this we could gain some friends from the student section in London. Śrīla Prabhupād expressed that if necessary we can supply them their own type of food—meat—from a restaurant. The main thing is that they will come and that they will try to understand our conception. His point of view was that if we make a big student home where perhaps one thousand can stay, if ten men will come in the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness we shall feel ourselves successful. Why? Because it is a very rare thing to come in the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It was his proposal that we could gain some affection from the general younger section in this way, and for that, he was prepared to forego our prestige."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj came from a very exalted brahminical family famous all over India, and earlier he was very attached to brahminical standards. When Śrīla Prabhupād Saraswatī Ṭhākur mentioned the possibility of supplying meat, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was seated there and said to him, “Oh, Śrīla Prabhupād, our prestige will be lost if we arrange their non-vegetarian food to be brought from a restaurant.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Prabhupād Saraswatī Ṭhākur replied, “We shall supply everyone with vegetarian food, but if anyone cannot tolerate only vegetarian food, we shall try to supply according to their needs.” He showed such a degree of tolerance."},{"class":"b44","text":" But Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said, “We are Vaiṣṇavas. If we do that, everyone will abuse our mission, and that will not be good.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Prabhupād Saraswatī Ṭhākur responded, “A thousand births ago I considered this point and decided in this way.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then Śrīla Prabhupād Saraswatī Ṭhākur said something. Upon hearing this, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s conception became very clear: “Always you must be within Vaikuṇṭha-vṛtti. Your mood must be always the full serving mood, then you can use anything for the service of Kṛṣṇa.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Everything can be used in service to Kṛṣṇa, so why did Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj advise his disciples to follow the four directives, and from where did he get those directives? I shall explain."},{"class":"b44","text":" These are found in the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam. Actually there are not four, but five, directives given there: dyūtam, pānam, striyā, śunā and jāta-rūpam. But why did Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj avoid mentioning much about the last, gold?"},{"class":"b44","text":" Money is the main problem for the conditioned souls. They get everything through money: gambling, drinking and intoxication, illicit sex, and killing animals—meat eating. And these are the other four places Kālī was given to live in by Mahārāj Parīkṣit."},{"class":"b44","text":" Gambling, intoxication, illicit sex life and animal slaughter did not exist within the kingdom of Mahārāj Parīkṣit therefore Kālī feared for his life.

You can reside where there is gold—money.” In this way Kālī stays in five places, therefore actually there are five directives, but Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj did not stress much about the fifth, money. It is necessary to understand why. I can say the reason, and for that I have come here."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj always said, “You try to serve Kṛṣṇa in any way. And in any way you can, try to collect money for use in service to Him.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He knew how money was coming for his mission, but he digested all the sin behind it.

He had such power of digestion."},{"class":"b44","text":" He did not instruct, “Don’t bring money.” Instead he advised, “Go for preaching and book distribution. Everywhere money is needed otherwise it is not possible to preach, so also collect money.” He stood by that principle and he had the capacity to digest it. That is, he is a Śaktyāveś-avatār. He is an incarnation of the power of Nityānanda Prabhu, so he can digest everything."},{"class":"b44","text":" He said, “Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, therefore you are to serve Him in every respect and in every way. You can use everything in the service of Kṛṣṇa.” In this way he did not make others feel hopeless."},{"class":"b44","text":" He knew that it is a very difficult thing to use money, so he took all that charge himself.

That was his actual desire."},{"class":"b44","text":" Unlike Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj continued his preaching in a very small way. He did not want to make his mission very big. He wanted to stay in Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh without going anywhere else. He did not want to construct many buildings. His wish was to have just one building for the Deities, and in a part of that building he wanted one room for his quarters and one room for guests. That was his desire, but when he trained me he expected that I would do some service for the devotees."},{"class":"b44","text":" Many devotees started to come from the Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern worlds and Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said, “This mission is now growing very big.

In the sun there is air, oxygen, fire, and so many elements. But we cannot enter the sun-abode; we can only see an effulgent form from a distance. Similarly, to view the Lord from a great distance means to see only a form of effulgence."},{"class":"b44","text":" Further, another form of the Lord is Paramātmā. Paramātmā resides within all jīva-souls. All the souls act in various ways in this world, and the Paramātmā is always with them as the witness. The individual souls by nature are implicated by their actions, but the Lord, with His transcendental nature, remains unaffected. Remaining ever-present within the souls, the Lord as Paramātmā observes the activities of the souls, or jīvātmās. Furthermore, He is also present in every atom of existence; so it is said in the scriptures that there is no place in creation where the Lord does not preside. When the souls try to enjoy the illusory energy of the Lord, māyā, they abandon their natural inner tendency for service and adopt the nature of an enjoyer. Still, the Lord desires to take even those fallen souls back home to His divine abode, known as Paravyoma Dhām, Vaikuṇṭha, or Goloka."},{"class":"b44","text":" The souls belong to the taṭastha-śakti, or marginal potency of the Lord. They are not born, but they are manifest by the will of the Lord. This is accepted in all the scriptures. When they are thus manifest, they appear in many forms."},{"class":"b44","text":" Whatever religious forms appear in the world, whether Christian, Buddhist, Muslim or Hindu, all are one with each other in that the aim of all is to reveal the same objective. The cause of the manifestation of this material world seen from various angles and distances of perception is the reason for different religious conceptions being preached in the world. But the Vedic religion, or the teachings given by the Vedas, show us that all souls are manifest from the marginal potency of the Lord; and from their manifestation, the potencies of thinking, feeling and willing remain with them. Since they possess these potencies, they are therefore units of life, units of consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is also shown in this scientific age of exploration of atoms, neutrons and protons, etc., that everything in existence is in a state of movement. Every atom has a certain measurement of other bodies revolving around it. Similarly, in the Vedic teachings we see that life is present everywhere. With their modern research and studies, the scientists are teaching us these things, but from thousands and thousands of years ago the Vedic teachings tell us that whatever exists in the world—everything is chetana. It is all conscious, living."},{"class":"b44","text":" Even a cement and brick building is chetana. Although at present we do not perceive any movement of the building, in a few hundred years we shall notice that a pillar or other part of the building has dissolved or undergone a reformation. Actually nothing has dissolved, but the internal action of the object has finally made itself visible to us."},{"class":"b44","text":" The state of chetana—consciousness or life—is present everywhere in two basic forms: sthāvara and jaṅgama, or stationary and moving. A tree is considered sthāvara, or stationary, yet there is life present in the tree. This has been discovered by a Bengali scientist, and it has been demonstrated with scientific instruments that a tree experiences pleasure and pain. So life is present everywhere, and life is called ātmā, or soul. In our body millions of life-forms, or souls, are present, but one principle soul guides the entire body as the master of the body, and he is called dehī or ātmā. In this way, life is present everywhere, and when it shows movement it is called jaṅgama, otherwise it is called sthāvara. When a soul leaves the body what happens? Within two or three days the body noticeably decays. The body can no longer move—although there is still movement in it by way of its decaying. After only a month or so only bones remain, and they too will later become fossilised. The observer or witness of all the actions of the moving souls is the Paramātmā. Paramātmā is present within everything in existence. This is the nature of the form of Paramātmā."},{"class":"b44","text":" Bhagavān is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and by His nature, His līlā, or divine Pastimes, continue eternally. In this relative world the taṭastha-śakti jīva-souls are bound as though in a prison-house, and this is a relative aspect of the Lord’s līlā. In a jail only a very small percentage of the population are found, maybe one percent or less. The normal population are not sent to jail—they reside at their homes and fulfil their works. The evil-doers are sent to jail by the law. The law is for everyone, but the jail is reserved for the violators of the law. So in the world there may be billions of humans, of which maybe only a few hundred thousand are imprisoned. The rest are free to live and do their business in the world. Similarly, in the transcendental world, which is known as Paravyoma Dhām, all the residents live their lives happily without any obstacles; this plane is also known as sevā-bhūmi, or the land of service. There, everyone gives joy to one another. As everyone serves the Supreme Lord, He also serves them—as a son serves his father and a father serves his son. This is similar to what we find in this world where fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters all live happily together."},{"class":"b44","text":" But what is our work here? Some become husbands, some masters, some servants, etc., but what is their real work? Service. That is everyone’s work here. A father accepts service from his sons but he also serves them by rearing and nourishing them. So service is the work of everyone. But in this world that service only remains temporarily and thus cannot afford us real value. If we construct a grand house we think that our son will live there, our daughter will live there, our relatives will live there; we shall have a TV set and live happily there. But soon our lifetime will be over. Somehow or other in the end we shall leave this world, and this must happen to us. Our juniors are also leaving this world. It is not a matter of seniors going and juniors staying, and at every moment we see that in this or that village or town people are going, they are dying one by one."},{"class":"b44","text":" We have sufficient experience that as soon as one leaves this body he must leave this world, and no one can live forever within this body. After ten or twenty years, or twenty-five or a hundred years, or two or four months—whatever the time may be, everyone must die. Death is inevitable. As long as there is birth, death is inevitable. So no matter how hard we try, we cannot know happiness here. Today we need money, but is a rich man happy? What is his fate? He may end up with severe stomach trouble and be unable to eat more than a few grains of rice. And one who has beauty cannot be happy either. When his pulse goes wrong he worries why he has become ill, why he has become thin. Today we see that someone has become a great celebrity, but tomorrow he may not have even the power to walk. In this way, the whole world is temporary, and although we are attached to this temporary world we cannot remain here forever."},{"class":"b44","text":" We cannot claim the house we have built as our own, and our son even won’t be able to enjoy it for very long. The money we deposited for our son’s welfare may be squandered by him for drugs and other useless or injurious things. One man saves while the other squanders. This is the way of the world."},{"class":"b44","text":" So all souls have appeared from the marginal potency, or taṭastha-śakti, of the Lord, and their own home is the vast and infinite transcendental world, Paravyoma Dhām, and they mostly all go there and happily serve the Lord. It is only a small handful of souls like us that cast their glance upon the prison-house of this illusory world of Māyā despite the opportunity to serve in the transcendental world; from that fateful glance their misfortune is born. Beyond this we cannot consider any other cause of the jīva-souls coming to this world, so we must admit the cause of their coming here is simply their misfortune. When they see Māyā they think, “Here is the object of my enjoyment. I am superior, and that is inferior.” Therefore they are attracted to this māyik, or illusory, plane, which is just like a prison-house."},{"class":"b44","text":" Still, the Supreme Lord has made all arrangements for taking them back to the transcendental world. Sometimes when too many disturbances arise He comes here Himself, just as when disturbances arise in a prison, a senior officer or administrator comes personally and fires a few shots here and there to manage the situation. The Supreme Lord descends Personally. He is the Supremely Powerful, so He has no anxiety. When Nārāyaṇ comes from Vaikuṇṭha there is no question of Him ‘leaving Vaikuṇṭha empty.’ Simply by His will another Nārāyaṇ can descend here. Also with Him are the potencies of thinking, feeling and willing, but that plane is chetana, or conscious and living, while this plane is jaḍa, mundane or material."},{"class":"b44","text":" The illusory nature of this plane is also the potency of the Supreme Lord, but this potency is like a shadow. Fire has both its form as well as its shadow. The form of fire has its own existence, without which a shadow would not appear. By dint of light, shadow makes its appearance. And we have fallen into this shadow-potency. This is a potency of the Supreme Lord, and it is also eternal. It will continue on and on. The divine Pastimes of the Lord—līlā—also go on eternally."},{"class":"b51","text":" The holy book Bhagavad-gītā is now known all over the world. Many will know the famous verse:"},{"class":"b60","text":" yadā yadā hi dharmasya<br />glānir bhavati bhārata<br />abhyuttānām adharmasya<br />tad ātmānāṁ sṛjāmy aham"},{"class":"b50","text":" When severe discrepancies in the rules and regulations of religion appear in the world, the Supreme Lord comes personally to set matters right. How? Paritrāṇāya sādhūnam. There may be some good souls in this world—of the prisoners in a jail, there may be many who aspire for their own good. To protect them, rescue them from their trials and to take them up, the Lord Himself comes."},{"class":"b60","text":" paritrāṇāya sādhūnaṁ<br />vināśāya cha duṣkṛtām<br />dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya<br />sambhavāmi yuge yuge"},{"class":"b43","text":" So when the Lord comes, all evil disappears just as with the appearance of light, darkness is dispelled. As soon as the Lord appears in the world, all the darkness of the world vanishes. All the jīva-souls constantly emanate from the marginal potency of the Lord, therefore the illusory world is again filled up, as a jail never stays vacant. When each prisoner’s term is up they one by one leave to enjoy their fortune."},{"class":"b51","text":" We have seen that sometimes when a country attains independence, all its prisoners are released. Sometimes when a president of a nation is changed, for the honour of the new president many prisoners are released. All these things are seen in the world from time to time, but all these matters are only the shadow of the original cause. So when the Supreme Lord appears, so many souls are rescued and leave this world forever. Sometimes He comes Himself and sometimes He sends His representative. The representative is known as the sādhu or Guru. He comes here to teach the souls, “Jīv jāgo, jīv jāgo, Gaurāchā̐da bole, kota nidrā jāo māyā piśāchīra kole—you are all sleeping here! Wake up! Wake up to your real selves! You are transcendental, conscious life, and your home is the transcendental world of divine consciousness and life. There you will find everything, your house, your home.

Similarly, as spiritual rays of the Lord, we are endowed with powers of thinking, feeling and willing. As the Lord is Pūrṇa-chetana or the supreme original conscious entity, we, the individual souls, are aṇu-chetana, or atomic particles of consciousness. In the Śvetāśvatara-upaniṣad the soul is described as being so subtle that it is invisible to the eye:"},{"class":"b60","text":" bālāgra-śata-bhāgasya<br />śata-dhā kalpitasya cha<br />bhāgo jīvaḥ sa vijñeyaḥ<br />sa chānantyāya kalpate"},{"class":"b50","text":" The tip of a hair divided ten thousand times is a general estimation of the subtle form of the jīva. So he is invisible. But despite his minuteness, his power is great. He resides in the deepest recesses of the heart in such a subtle form, and to date he has never been seen. Nowadays some scientists say they can photograph some hazy shadow aspect of the soul, but still they could not ascertain the infinitesimal form of the soul. As this body is a covering, the soul also has a covering as mentioned in the Gītā:"},{"class":"b60","text":" indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur<br />indriyebhyaḥ paraṁ manaḥ<br />manasas tu parā buddhir<br />buddher yaḥ paratas tu saḥ"},{"class":"b43","text":" These are all more and more subtle coverings of the soul. More subtle than this bodily type of covering is the covering of the senses; more subtle than the senses is the covering made of the mind; more subtle than that is the intelligence; and more subtle still is the soul—ātmā."},{"class":"b44","text":" So the soul resides within so many layers of coverings, and its form is still unknown to us."},{"class":"b51","text":" Still, even though the soul is infinitesimal in size, it is a particle of conscious life; and it eternally possesses the potent qualities of conscious life: thinking, feeling and willing. Anything having potency can act—whether with good or bad actions—and such potency of the soul is actually very great. A candle flame may be very tiny, but from such a tiny flame a gigantic fire can be ignited. From the tiny candle a larger candle can be ignited, and a larger one still; and the power of the large candle is of an equal nature to the small one. Their burning power is non-different. Similarly, the sat, chit and ānanda—the potent qualities of eternal existence, consciousness and ecstasy—found in the original form of the Supreme Lord are also found within the soul, who is a part (aṁśa) of the Lord. However, at present the soul is covered. Light burns within a lightbulb, but the fire that causes that light cannot be found outside the bulb, although some heat is apparent. There is also cold fire, like neon for example, where even heat seems to be absent. In the microphone there is the invisible fire of electricity doing its work. We cannot perceive that fire, but we see from the results that its work is being accomplished. In this way, the action of power moves in many, many forms. So the potency of the jīva-soul can be used for either good or evil. When fortunate souls are ready to use their energy for good, if anyone disturbs them the Lord comes personally and destroys the disturbing elements. Those who want good are good. Thus He has said in the Gītā, “I come to protect the saints and to vanquish the evil-doers.” The less good that one wants, the more he is punished, and one who aspires for good is given a chance by the Lord: “Yes, you want good, so may you be virtuous. Virtue is your own wealth. What shall I take from you? I am full in Myself.” In the Upaniṣads we find:"},{"class":"b60","text":" oṁ pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇam idaṁ<br />pūrṇat pūrṇam udachyate<br />pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya<br />pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate"},{"class":"b43","text":" “The infinite whole source of all Avatārs and the infinite whole Avatār—both are whole, that is, full with all potencies. The infinite whole Avatār appears from the infinite whole source of all Avatārs for the purpose of manifesting His Pastimes. In order to fulfil His Pastimes, the infinite whole Avatār accepts His infinite whole form, and finally the infinite whole source of all Avatārs remains present; so in no way can the infinite completeness of the Supreme Lord ever suffer any diminution.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" So if the infinite whole is subtracted from the infinite whole, the infinite whole yet remains. In the scriptures the Supreme Lord is described as nija-lābha-pūrṇa—He is perfect and complete in Himself. Therefore He feels no necessity for Himself; still, by virtue of His willing potency (ichchhā-śakti) His Pastimes go on, and by His Pastimes the fortunate devotee souls offer themselves to Him through divine service, and He too serves them and ecstatically gives Himself to them. In that service exchange, the ecstasy that the Lord feels is felt twice as much by His devotees. This is the nature of that transcendental world, Paravyoma Dhām, the divine abode of Goloka."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Lord also has many different forms, and in each form He enjoys certain corresponding Pastimes; and the jīva-souls can gain the fitness to enter into particular Pastimes according to the classification of their pure devotion. The gradations of ecstatic divine relationship are known as śānta-, dāsya-, sakhya-, vātsalya-, and madhura-rasas, or passive service, active service, friendship, parenthood and consorthood. The pure devotees render service to the Lord according to the rasa of their inner heart’s attraction. We normally speak of ‘service to the Lord,’ but we should know that the Lord Himself also serves His devotee. When Kṛṣṇa stole butter Mother Yaśodā chased him with a stick. “Why have you stolen butter?

In this case the Lord serves His devotee in this mood of dealings as the son of His devotee."},{"class":"b44","text":" The relationship of consorthood takes place between the Lord and the gopīs."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the divine abode, full-fledged service in the five types of divine relationships continues eternally. In the abode of the Lord’s four-armed Nārāyaṇ form the appropriate services go on; in the Abode of the Lord’s Rāmachandra form, the appropriate services go on, as the Lord manifests Himself in those particular expansions and forms of different divine moods. But we worship Śrī Kṛṣṇachandra with His eternal divine Pastimes, because it is in such form, His most original form, that full-fledged service is manifest in all the five rasas, and this is the supreme ecstasy for the jīva-souls. Such ecstasy cannot be experienced anywhere else."},{"class":"b44","text":" The friends of the Lord say, “Let us play! Whoever is defeated must carry the winner on his shoulders!” When they take a bite from some nice fruit they immediately offer it to the mouth of Kṛṣṇa, saying, “Oh, Brother, this is so tasty—come on, please take some!” All such friendly, familiar dealings are found only in Kṛṣṇa-līlā and nowhere else. The gopīs accept Kṛṣṇa as their husband in their thought and actions also. Such service they render to the Lord. So we have heard about the Lord’s Pastimes and we have heard about His Holy Name, and if we get a connection there, we can have the chance to be allowed into those Pastimes. This is the way of Bhakti, and this is called devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; and He is Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b51","text":" Just see how sweet the name ‘Kṛṣṇa’ is. ‘Kṛṣṇa’ means ‘He who attracts all the souls to His abode, and gives them ecstasy.’ That is Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b59","text":" kṛṣir bhū-vāchakaḥ śabdo<br />ṇaś cha nirvṛti-vāchakaḥ<br />tayor aikyaṁ paraṁ brahma<br />kṛṣṇa ity abhidhīyate"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Mahābhārata)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “The root ‘Kṛṣ’ expresses the all-attractive existence, and the word ‘ṇa’ expresses the supreme ecstasy. The two combined give the Name ‘Kṛṣṇa,’ ascertaining the Parama Brahma—the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Godhead.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He is attracting everyone, yet He never takes away the independence that He has given us. This can be seen as both the fortune and the misfortune of the jīva-souls. The Lord has given independence to all souls—from their very inception they have the potency of thinking, feeling and willing. This independence has been given to us by the Lord. Why? So that by our own desire and free wish we can engage ourselves in His service. With as much power at our command, as much as we desire, we can combine everything we have and render divine service to the Lord."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Lord’s feeling is, “I have given you independence, and I will not take it back. If you want to serve Me, you may do so; otherwise you can go to Māyā. You may do as you wish. But you will be happy if you render service to Me. Why will you be happy? If you serve the eternal, you will reap the eternal fruit; if you serve the temporal, you must reap the temporary fruit.” ‘To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction,’ as the scientist Newton said in his third law. So Kṛṣṇa is saying, “Do My service and your service will be done twice as well.” When Kṛṣṇa’s friend is eating a very sweet fruit, he will give that fruit to Kṛṣṇa, “See, Brother, you will like this very much.” Then Kṛṣṇa eats some and says, “Yes, this is excellent, but how shall I eat it alone? You also eat!” Then they both eat very happily. We also hear about the Pastimes of Kṛṣṇa with the gopīs on the banks of the Yamunā. Kṛṣṇa gives happiness to all, even to the point of giving Himself. If anyone is unhappy, He gives them double happiness. And the conception that has been given to us by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu is most elevated: Viraha-milana, the conception of union in separation, is the bestower of the greatest joy. In the world we may have some feelings resembling that. If a man has gone to a very far and distant land and could not return home to his wife for as long as three or four years, when he finally returns home, how much joy do they both feel? We can just imagine how much joy the husband and wife feel in their hearts."},{"class":"b52","text":" After a great separation, the joy of reunion is the highest and supermost joy. Such joy is found in the Pastimes of Kṛṣṇa, and not other pastimes. Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s gift is to give everyone a chance to aspire to become a member of those Pastimes and live in Vṛndāvan. There you will find forest flowers, cows, milk, cream, cheese; you can play with Kṛṣṇa, run with Kṛṣṇa, meet with Kṛṣṇa— everything, you can do with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes are the most ecstatic of all."}]},{"title":"Our Super Benefit","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b47","text":" Our Super Benefit"},{"class":"b35","text":" The second part of the previous lecture"},{"class":"b43","text":" When as a young lad of 17 I joined with Śrīla Guru Mahārāj in 1947, he said to me, “I will not be here in Calcutta at all times, so you learn Bhagavad-gītā from Swāmī Mahārāj Prabhupād.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" When Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj read the Gītā he would translate it and also teach it to me.

One of the questions that came up was, “Oh, why don’t you worship Mother Kālī? If you worship her she will give you everything. Just pray, “Dhanaṁ dehī, rūpaṁ dehī, janaṁ dehī, yaśaṁ dehī,” You’ll get everything—wealth, beauty, family, prestige. You’ll get everything, so why don’t you worship Mother Kālī?

You are a devotee of Kṛṣṇa and you worship Kṛṣṇa, that’s no problem; and they are devotees of Mother Kālī, that’s also no problem.

You will reach the place of Mother Kālī. By doing her service, when she is satisfied with you, you will become one of her associates. What is your gain in becoming one of her associates, and where will you go? She lives in the cremation ground, otherwise she lives peacefully with Lord Śiva in the Himalayas. There it is absolutely freezing. If you go to join her in the cremation ground there is another disturbance—when you become her associate, what kind of form will you take? All her associates have the forms of witches, wizards, ghosts and spirits; she has two sons with such forms, and you also will have to take such a form! No doubt you can get the wealth, family and other things that you are praying for, but when she is satisfied by your worship what will you get? Think about that. And Mother Kālī also has a special nature—she goes naked. The artists paint pictures of her clothed, but the scriptures tell us that she goes naked. She covers herself with hands. Whose hands? The hands of her own sons. You call her ‘mother’—so whose mother is she? She’s your mother. And she cuts off the hands of the demons and uses their hands as her clothing. She attracts them, chops off their heads and uses their skulls as a garland. What good will you get from that? And after becoming her devotee you will have to become a witch or ghost to live with her!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" That was Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj’s reply.

We will reach the home of Kṛṣṇa!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" So Kṛṣṇaloka is the plane of the most special transcendental Pastimes of Kṛṣṇa. There, the highest divine play takes place, covering the principal divine relationships of dāsya-, sakhya-, vātsalya-, and madhura-rasa."},{"class":"b44","text":" In Nārāyaṇloka or Vaikuṇṭhaloka the Pastimes take place within two and a half rasas beginning with śānta-rasa, then dāsya-rasa and half sakhya-rasa. It is never mentioned in the scriptures that Nārāyaṇ has any friends. All are His reverential servants, or half-friends, like Lakṣmī Devī, Nārāyaṇ’s consort. Her mood with Nārāyaṇ is always, “Please, what is Your order my Lord?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" She can never behave with familiarity like a sakhī (lady-friend) and chide Him, “Kṛṣṇa, go away!” But in Vaikuṇṭha all dealings with the Lord in His Nārāyaṇ form are mainly on the level of reverential servitude. This is not the case in Kṛṣṇaloka; there, Mother Yaśodā may pull Kṛṣṇa’s ear and chastise Him, “Oh what is this wrong you have done?” And Kṛṣṇa accordingly will also play with her as her son."},{"class":"b44","text":" Once some cowherd girls, gopīs, came to Mother Yaśodā’s house and accused Kṛṣṇa of some misbehaviour. They went to Mother Yaśodā and gave her a report, accusing that, “Your son comes to our house and does such and such. He creates disturbances, and our milk and other dairy foods are spoiled by his meddling.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then Kṛṣṇa denies, “No, no!

Now I shall retaliate by coming to you all as your husband; what will you do about that?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Such are the Pastimes in Kṛṣṇaloka. But this play of Kṛṣṇa cannot be found in any other form of the Lord. For example, Lord Rāmachandra is the Godhead Himself, Pūrṇa-brahma—the all-perfect Supreme Godhead, completely transcendental to the mundane plane. But what does He show us in His līlā? He resides completely within the jurisdiction of law. He always gives full honour to all the Vedic laws and injunctions. He never breaks any of the rulings, infallibly. This is His behaviour at all times. For this reason He is famous as Maryādā-puruṣottama, or the Supreme Lord as the protector of Vedic rulings. He is none other than the Supreme Lord Himself, but He manifests this special aspect. Although He is free and independent of all rules and regulations, He shows this full subordination to the Vedic codes of conduct. When it came to His ear that, “Your wife was in another’s house,” He immediately banished Śrīmati Sītā Devī to the forest. So in this incarnation, the Lord manifests the nature of complete subordination to law."},{"class":"b44","text":" But as Kṛṣṇa there is no such question of law. The question of law never enters His thoughts. His freedom is absolute, but there we find love, beauty, charm—as much affection of the heart as is ever possible, as much beauty as can ever be possible, as much attraction as can ever be known in the world and beyond—everything is found in its fullest possibility in Kṛṣṇa-līlā."},{"class":"b51","text":" When Kṛṣṇa personally appeared in this world, He Himself declared, “I am the Supreme Lord!” In the teachings of the Gītā we find this all through:"},{"class":"b59","text":" tam eva śaraṇaṁ gachchha<br />sarvva-bhāvena bhārata...."},{"class":"b54","text":" (Bg: 18.62)"},{"class":"b50","text":" And:"},{"class":"b59","text":" māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśrītya<br />te ‘pi syu’h pāpa-yonayaḥ<br />striyo vaiśyas tathā śūdrās<br />te ‘pi yānti parāṁ gatim"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Bg: 9.32)"},{"class":"b50","text":" “O Arjuna, whoever takes full shelter in Me, whether they are low-born as sinful outcastes, women, vaiśyas or śūdras—they too will attain the supreme objective; taking their own internal divine form they go to the topmost plane, the plane of My service.”"},{"class":"b60","text":" sarvva-dharmān parityajya<br />mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja"},{"class":"b50","text":" Kṛṣṇa is saying, “I am the Supreme Lord, the Supreme God.

As we mentioned before, there are many forms of the Lord, such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Vāmana, etc. He reveals Himself in these various forms according to the particular nature of His various Pastimes. But the Pastimes of Kṛṣṇa are so elevated; the Lord makes the law, the Lord breaks the law, yet nothing can touch Him. In such a form the Supreme Lord has His transcendental play. Therefore it is mentioned in Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (1.3.28):"},{"class":"b60","text":" ete chāmśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ<br />kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayaṁ"},{"class":"b43","text":" The Lord has infinite expansions and sub-expansions, all embodying the supreme potency of Godhead, but Kṛṣṇa is the Original Supreme Godhead Himself, Bhagavān. So in His original form—Bhagavān— Kṛṣṇa plays His Pastimes; and in His indwelling supersoul form— Paramātmā —He resides within the hearts of all living beings. Therefore the divine principles of Vaiṣṇavism teach us—jīve sammāna dibe jāni’ ‘Kṛṣṇa’- adhiṣṭhāna (Cc: 3.20.25) —to give obeisances to all souls, to give respect to all, knowing Kṛṣṇa to be resident there. If it is your son, you must still offer him obeisances; but that is to be done mentally. Otherwise it will not be to the child’s benefit, for he will think, “My father is offering me obeisances, so I am superior to him.” But he should be respected with the knowledge that the Lord is residing within his heart. This is the principle."},{"class":"b44","text":" So today you have all assembled here to hear the messages of the Lord. The Lord Himself is your own natural wealth, and in your hearts the Lord is gloriously presiding.

The transcendental knowledge given by the Lord in Gītā is greatly respected all over the world. Why? Because the teachings given there are for one and all. The book itself is very compact—700 verses. The Śrīmad Bhāgavatam is 18,000 verses, and the Mahābhārata is 100,000 verses.

Even an anarchist may be found to be keeping the Gītā in his pocket, because the way to attain detachment is clearly given therein. This knowledge of Gītā now pervades and commands the respect of the world; even Russia. The knowledge of the Gītā is so unprejudiced.

Just see, it is crying.’ So at birth, all a baby can do is cry, but the rest of the world laughs.

Everything is the wealth and property of the Lord. Whatever we eat we shall first offer to Him and then take His divine remnants, prasādam. If we shall give anything to anyone we shall first offer it to the Lord and give that to a devotee for their service to Him.

Nothing inauspicious will be able to enter there—everything will be auspicious. This is the service of the Supreme Lord, Bhagavān. “Sarvaṁ karmākhilaṁ pārtha jñāne parisamāpyate (Bg: 4.33)—all these varieties of sacrificial works culminate in knowledge divine.” This means that the acme of knowledge is bhakti:"},{"class":"b60","text":" tapasvibhyo ‘dhiko yogī<br />jñānibhyo ‘pi mato ‘dhikaḥ<br />karmibhyaś chādhiko yogī<br />tasmād yogī bhavārjuna"},{"class":"b59","text":" yoginām api sarveṣāṁ<br />mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā<br />śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ<br />sa me yuktatamo mataḥ"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Bhagavad-gītā: 6.46,47)"},{"class":"b59","text":" bahūnāṁ janmanām ante<br />jñānavān māṁ prapadyate<br />vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti<br />sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Bhagavad-gītā: 7.19)"},{"class":"b43","text":" Such are the teachings of the Lord in the Bhagavad-gītā.

But the Lord says, man-niketan tu nirguṇam: “Whoever lives in My home lives in the transcendental plane. He is not bound by those mundane qualities. Whatever is done in My plane is done with devotion for Me, bhakti, and that devotion is the source of all blessings and benedictions.” Thus bhakti has been given the absolutely highest position in all scriptures. Whether you are capable of doing anything or not, offer yourself, surrender yourself unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Whether you are a gṛhastha, sannyāsī or brahmachārī is not the point, whatever you may be, you will get your supreme benefit. This is the direction of our Vedic religion."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, as I said before, you have assembled here today to hear about Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I have tried with all my might to speak to you about Him. And you have given me much time in which to do so. I consider myself blessed because you have all so patiently heard these talks about the Lord. I want to do some good for you all. There are so many forms of religion, but real religion is in your hearts. That is your potency, and that is your wealth—and that is love for the Supreme Lord, divine love, prema. It is in the hearts of all, and it is for all. The Lord is engaging in a loving search for the lost servants. As the Lord searches for His servants, you also have the tendency to search for Him."},{"class":"b44","text":" We can take some help from the ground, like a small child trying to walk for the first time. In the beginning he falls down, but taking the help of the ground he again stands, regains confidence and finally, after a few attempts, begins to walk. When the same child grows, he may well be able to run the four-minute mile. He gets such strength. Similarly, we live in this world, and taking what help we can get in this world we can begin to walk on the path of the life of devotion for the supreme goal. Then we can have our super benefit. We need to invite the attitude to want to do good for others. In that way we will get our own benefit and we shall be able to do good for the entire world. Viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate. We want to be able to live our lives and maintain our families through our service without exploiting others, and automatically we shall see that no burden will ever come to us."},{"class":"b51","text":" If we are not the cause for the birth of others, then we, accordingly, will not be born. This is also thought out by many brahmachārīs, so they avoid marriage and go on in life as free men. But those who marry—they also have their religious life. Actually, according to the scriptures they hold the highest position in the world of religious thought because they are the maintainers of all the other āśrams, the religious categories into which humankind is divided. So from whatever position you may be in now, you can start on the journey towards Kṛṣṇaloka. You are already in the life of searching for happiness and preventing unhappiness, but it is already the law of nature of this world that joy and sorrow will come and go automatically."},{"class":"b59","text":" mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya<br />śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ<br />āgamāpāyino ‘nityās<br />tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Bhagavad-gītā: 2.14)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “O son of Kuntī, the contact of the senses reacting with their objects give the sensations of cold and heat, pleasure and pain.

After the sun rises, it later sets; again it rises, again it sets. So happiness comes, then sadness; after sadness again comes happiness. There is no shortage of happiness in this world. It will come automatically. But when we have attained this human form of life, and when we have heard about the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa and come to know a little about His holy abode through the scriptures and the association of devotees, we shall get the aspiration to find our own home, the soil of the soul. If we simply make the attempt to proceed to that transcendental world we will come to our natural position."},{"class":"b44","text":" We all know that none of us can remain in this world. We all have to leave one day. But if we only once aspire to proceed to our own home, we will get much opportunity. The Lord will surely bless us. The Lord says that even if one dies before completing his spiritual practising life, in the next life he will be given a higher position (śuchīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo ‘bhijāyate). One who only once makes the attempt for auspiciousness is never a victim of inauspiciousness (na hi kalyāṇa-kṛt kaśchid durgatiṁ tāta gachchhati). He can progress to a higher and higher destiny."},{"class":"b44","text":" The wisdom of the Gītā is so beautiful. Everything needed to be known, for everyone, is found there. This is why the Gītā is preached throughout the world. The elevated saintly persons declare that Śrī Gītā is the entry standard for spiritual life. If one can first properly appreciate the Gītā, then he can aspire for a higher position; it is like passing the entrance examination before entering college. Everybody’s primary benefit is to be found, therefore, in the Gītā."},{"class":"b51","text":" I thank you all very much for giving me this time today.

In a very simple and charming way he has delivered to us some words about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As it was mentioned by a respected guest earlier today, “I see Śrīla A.C. Bhaktivedānta Prabhupād in Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj.” This is no accident, because Śrīla Prabhupād and Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj are very intimately connected. For many years in India they lived together, and Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj was like a son to Śrīla Prabhupād. He said, “I consider Govinda Mahārāj as my most beloved son, actually.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" It was from Śrīla Prabhupād that Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj studied Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā. Śrīla Prabhupād himself studied from Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj’s Guru, Śrīla Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj."},{"class":"b44","text":" So these three form a very intimate group."},{"class":"b44","text":" After Śrīla Prabhupād left the world in 1977 we had Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj to guide and shelter us. We all felt the need that after Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s disappearance there would be someone to continue presenting these teachings in a genuine and authentic way. I knew from both Śrīla Prabhupād and Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj that the person would be Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj. For this reason I, and others, many times invited him to travel around the world. It is therefore a special event for me that he has kindly taken me with him on these travels."},{"class":"b44","text":" Here in Mauritius we have all had the opportunity to hear how Śrīla Mahārāj has given us a very happy idea about serving Kṛṣṇa. He has also expressed much appreciation for this lovely country."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Vaiṣṇavas never say, “I am Guru.” They never show themselves as being superior to us. Śrīla Mahārāj always said, “I am a simple man. Śrīla Prabhupād was a great Guru, but I am a simple man and I do not know if I can do such big things.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" But gradually from all over the world people came to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s home, Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh in Nabadwīp, and as they went back to their own homes around the world they also felt, “We need such a teacher.” Consequently they sent more and more invitations. The result is that now, like Śrīla Prabhupād, Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj is doing these same things and is spreading the exalted teachings of the Śrī Rūpānuga sampradāya around the world."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Vaiṣṇava, the devotee of God, the devotee of Kṛṣṇa, is the real friend of all living beings and of all human society. He is their natural friend, and he has no enemy in the world. He gives us the teachings of how we also can became Vaiṣṇavas. ‘Vaiṣṇava’ means ‘the servant of God, Viṣṇu.’ One who belongs to Viṣṇu is called a Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇavas are not sectarian religionists."},{"class":"b44","text":" Dharma is often translated as ‘religion’. But dharma comes from the original root word dhri which means ‘to hold’. It means that our very nature, the substantial part that holds us in our life, is dharma. Vaiṣṇava-dharma is our original nature, and it is also called jaiva-dharma. Jaiva comes from the word jīva. As Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj explained here, the jīva is the soul; that is, you and I. We are souls, and our nature is to serve God, to serve Kṛṣṇa. But now our original spiritual nature has become covered by mundane association, the material world. Therefore the Vaiṣṇava saints come from time to time to awaken us to our original natural self of being a servant of Kṛṣṇa. In Bengali this is called jīvera ‘svarūpa’ haya—Kṛṣṇera ‘nitya-dāsa’. We are not only servants of Kṛṣṇa in the morning or in the evening, but eternally. Eternal means that there is no beginning, and no end. It is our natural position to serve Him, and we can serve Him through the mercy and grace of the Vaiṣṇava teachers like Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj."},{"class":"b44","text":" Service to Kṛṣṇa is the most natural function of the soul. It is not a matter of converting anybody from this religion to that religion. It is already the natural function within the soul of all beings. And, as Śrīla Mahārāj has kindly told us, if we start this knowledge from our childhood and through our youth-hood, it will stay with us eternally. In such a way we shall have a start in life and we shall have some purpose."},{"class":"b44","text":" In French there is a nice expression, ‘raison d’être’. We must have ‘raison d’être’, we must have a goal in life, we must have a purpose in life, not only eating. When we are hungry we can only think about eating, and when we are tired we can only think about sleeping. Later on we may marry and have a family and we may have to fight for our family and for our country. But these things alone are not everything. There is ‘raison d’être’. There is a reason for living, beyond and above our bodily existence."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Mahārāj has pointed out to us that we are not this body. The person in this body goes from boyhood to youth to old age. An old person once had a young body, but in both bodies he is the same person, the same soul. Similarly you were also in a young baby’s body, now you are in a young lady’s or gentleman’s body. Your body will become older and old, but you are the same person. From young, to being youthful, to adult, to older, you are the same person; only the body is changing. And that person is spiritual. He or she is jīvātma, a living soul. The soul is spiritual and has some spiritual work to do, some spiritual function to do, and that is service to God."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is Śrīla Mahārāj’s observation, and also mine by his grace, that in Mauritius you all naturally have that Godly heart. It is a very happy thing to see, because your future will be very great and bright."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Śrīla Prabhupād came here it was reported that he said, “This country can all become Vaiṣṇavas. They can all become devotees of God.” He had that vision to see. And Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj also has told us like that. He feels very much happy and at home here."},{"class":"b52","text":" Just as we were so fortunate to have the association of Śrīla Prabhupād, we are now so lucky to have Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj. He is carrying the same current. He is a personality of the same soil, the same land. He can, and is, giving us these teachings."}]},{"title":"- Appendix I -","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b35","text":" Śrī Śrī Guru Gaurāṅgau Jayataḥ"},{"class":"b47","text":" - Appendix I -"},{"class":"b42","text":" Āchārya-charaṇa-vandana"},{"class":"b42","text":" Glorification of<br />Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj"},{"class":"b35","text":" Composed (and translated) by<br />His Holiness Śrīpād Bhakti Ānanda Sāgar Mahārāj"},{"class":"b60","text":" jaya śrīla mahārāja charaṇāravinda<br />śrī bhakti sundara deva-gosvāmī govinda [1]"},{"class":"b60","text":" jagatera sumaṅgala koribāra āśe<br />tumi avatīrṇa hoilā snigdha guru-veśe [2]"},{"class":"b60","text":" praphulla nalina jena hāsimākhā mukha<br />dekhi vṛdha-bāla-juvā pāya mahā-sukha [3]"},{"class":"b60","text":" svadeśe-videśe harināmera prachāre<br />abhinava gaura-preme bhāsāle sabāre [4]"},{"class":"b60","text":" śrī-kore lekhanī jena ananta phoyārā<br />sumadhura divyavāṇī-vigalita-dhārā [5]"},{"class":"b60","text":" su-siddhānta-dhārādhara satya sugambhīra<br />śrī-guru-vaiṣṇava-sevā-niṣṭha mahādhīra [6]"},{"class":"b60","text":" sādhu-priya saralatā tomāra bhūṣaṇa<br />amānī mānada sadā miṣṭha-sambhāṣaṇa [7]"},{"class":"b60","text":" guru-mahārāja jatirāja-rājeśvara<br />śrī-bhakti-rakṣaka deva-gosvāmī śrīdhara [8]"},{"class":"b60","text":" parama santuṣṭa tava viśrambha-sevāya<br />nija-hāte vyāsāsane vasā’la tomāya [9]"},{"class":"b60","text":" sukhe manonīta koilā uttarādhikārī<br />ehena apūrva sneha kothāo nā heri [10]"},{"class":"b60","text":" rūpa-sarasvatī-śrīdhar-dhārā-srotasvinī<br />tava hṛde vahe sada bhuvana pāvanī [11]"},{"class":"b60","text":" śīva-guru-saṅkarṣaṇa koruṇā-nilaya<br />nityānanda-rūpe tava hṛde vilasaya [12]"},{"class":"b60","text":" sujana sudhīra-gaṇa tava guṇa-gāya<br />durbhāgā vañchita aparādhe mare hāya [13]"},{"class":"b60","text":" guru-gaura-kṛṣṇa-sevā-saubhāgya-prakāśe<br />sānande sāgara bhāse saṅkīrtana rāse [14]"},{"class":"b42","text":" All glory to the Divine Master and<br />the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Chaitanya"},{"class":"b42","text":" Āchārya-charaṇa-vandana"},{"class":"b43","text":" Glory to the lotus feet of our Śrī Gurudev<br />Śrī Bhakti Sundar Dev-Goswāmī Govinda.
