And I say that because Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj has always been seen by us to be in the background of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh; moving, and doing so many different things, and acting as an agent of representation for so many devotees to the lotus feet of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj. He did this because, as we know, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s nature was not to move with a large group of people. In fact after his time in the Gauḍīya Maṭh and also after some attempts to work cooperatively with others, he more or less decided to enter seclusion; but he realised that Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupāda’s whole mission relied upon his coming out of seclusion."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupāda himself was a qualified <span class=\\"e3\\">bhajanānandī.</span> At one time he was chanting three lakh (300,000) Holy Names a day in the form of the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class=\\"e3\\">Mahāmantra.</span> In a month that comes dose to 10 million Names. His vow was to chant a billion Names of Kṛṣṇa which would take about eight and a half years to complete; and he was in the process of doing that. But from that position he received some divine inspiration to come out and help others. Sometimes it is said that once when he was crossing the River Saraswatī at its confluence with the Gaṅgā and Yamunā in the heart of Nabadwīp, a piece of paper floated up to him which contained a part of Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta describing the essential items of devotional service including preaching the glories of the Holy Name. He took it that this was what he should do, and of course we know the rest: he came out and gradually converted so many to Mahāprabhu’s creed."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was well aware that his Śrīla Prabhupāda did not favour devotion in seclusion, so he established the Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh and thought, “I’m not an aggressive preacher or canvaser, but if some will feel some relief from my <span class=\\"e3\\">Hari-kathā,</span> I won’t deny them.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Because Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was not inclined to do many of the various activities involved in preaching or to manage things so much, it made room for a very special assistant.

He was given the name Gaurendu Dāsa Brahmachārī and within a week, <span class=\\"e3\\">within a week,</span> Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was introducing him to other Godbrothers as his successor. He asked Kṛṣṇa Dāsa Bābājī Mahārāj, “I think this boy can be my successor.

They would become absorbed to such an extent that Śrīla Prabhupāda’s neglect of his pharmaceutical business downstairs partly led to its decline."},{"class":"b44","text":" Sometimes Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj would have breakfast with Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj Prabhupāda and he mentioned, “Even for breakfast Swāmī Mahārāj would always have some <span class=\\"e3\\">purīs</span> fried in ghee, as well as a little <span class=\\"e3\\">sabji</span> (cooked vegetable), and different things like that.” But Govinda Mahārāj and Guru Mahārāj were always keen to have <span class=\\"e3\\">muḍi</span> (puffed rice) on practically every occasion. Govinda Mahārāj said that Swāmī Mahārāj would always invite him to take <span class=\\"e3\\">purīs</span> and <span class=\\"e3\\">sabji</span> but he would decline saying, “No, no. <span class=\\"e3\\">Muḍi</span> is fine for me,” but Swāmī Mahārāj would object, <span class=\\"e3\\">“Muḍi?</span> That is simply cheating the stomach.” Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj was very happy during their stay there.

In that way the Absolute commits suicide.” Śrīla Guru Mahārāj used to tell that story often but I never heard him attribute it to Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj. Only later I learnt who that boy was! Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would sometimes comment, “One should not ask, ‘Can God commit suicide?’!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj many times revealed his brilliance before Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s Godbrothers. One occasion was at the Imlitalā Temple, a Temple established in Vṛndāvana by Śrīpād Bhakti Sāraṅga Goswāmī Mahārāj. When Mahāprabhu first entered Vṛndāvana He sat beneath the tree known as Imlitalā which is now in the courtyard of that Temple. There on the wall are some verses composed by Śrīla Guru Mahārāj inscribed in marble describing the exact date of Mahāprabhu’s arrival in Vṛndāvana, and the time of His <span class=\\"e3\\">līlā</span> beneath the Imlitalā."},{"class":"b44","text":" In Sanskrit verse there are ways to describe numbers by implication. For example, if you say <span class=\\"e3\\">Veda </span>it can mean the number three or four. This is because sometimes it is considered that there are three sections of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Vedas,</span> and sometimes four. There are also other words that numbers are associated with. Thus in a sort of mystical, poetic way Śrīla Guru Mahārāj mentioned the date, though that date generally is not known; it is only hinted at and described in a general way in Śrī <span class=\\"e3\\">Caitanya-caritāmṛta </span>and other places."},{"class":"b44","text":" When first reading the ślokas inscribed there, the Godbrothers of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj could not fully understand what he had written. From their understanding some were convinced that Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur might even have been of a different opinion concerning that date. So again the young Gaurendu Brahmachārī, our Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj, came and said, “Oh, I know what it means,” and they were all surprised. He then explained the date mentioned there. They reacted, “But that differs from the date given by Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Govinda Mahārāj replied, “That may be, but what my Guru says is right. What Śrīla Guru Mahārāj says is true; it does not matter if anyone else differs with it, whoever they are. It is true and I can prove it.” He then proceeded to expand on various passages and thereby he explained how Śrīla Guru Mahārāj came to those conclusions by inference from Śrī <span class=\\"e3\\">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> He astounded everyone."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj is always very competent, especially at representing Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and his conception, and he has a wonderful <span class=\\"e3\\">Vaiṣṇava</span> heart. It was shown one time in the following way:"},{"class":"b44","text":" Even the <span class=\\"e3\\">Gopīs</span> have groups and party spirit, this sometimes causes them not to get along with each other; and this is so also with their followers. In this way there were some differences between the different camps of Godbrothers of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and their disciples. One day many of them along with their disciples were going to Vṛndāvana to honour a holy festival. It so happened that Śrīpād Tīrtha Mahārāj and his disciples were at the same train station at the same time as Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and his entourage. Śrīpād Tīrtha Mahārāj was sometimes described by Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur as being most dear to him, <span class=\\"e3\\">Prabhupāda-preṣṭha,</span> and he even had verses in Tīrtha Mahārāj’s glorification chiselled into marble in the Bagh Bazaar Maṭh in Calcutta. But Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and Śrīpād Tīrtha Mahārāj at that time were not on speaking terms."},{"class":"b44","text":" Govinda Mahārāj noticed Tīrtha Mahārāj and seeing such an august personality he felt some disturbance at not being able to properly honour him due to the differences between the two parties. He then went and asked Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, “Tīrtha Mahārāj is over there. I feel compelled to offer my obeisances to him. May I have your permission to do so.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj replied, “Yes, of course you may.” The faces of Tīrtha Mahārāj and his group of devotees up to this point were a little stern, but Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj went over and offered his <span class=\\"e3\\">dandavats </span>to Tīrtha Mahārāj and talked a little with him as well as with his group, and soon they were all smiling: he had a way of charming all of them."},{"class":"b44","text":" Govinda Mahārāj always liked to glorify the devotees and he wrote many stanzas in their praise. With his charm he liked to utilise words in a way that allowed sometimes three or four meanings to be drawn out from each verse. Occasionally, though, others would interpret his verses in other ways than he intended, as was shown when he once wrote a poem glorifying Śrīpād Keśava Mahārāj. Keśava Mahārāj took <span class=\\"e3\\">sannyāsa</span> from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and he was an important figure in the Gauḍīya Maṭh. He was so pleased with the poem composed by Govinda Mahārāj that he published it in his <span class=\\"e3\\">Maṭh’s</span> journal."},{"class":"b44","text":" Later when Kṛṣṇa Dāsa Bābājī Mahārāj came and read it he saw that there was a double-entendre throughout. Although apparently on the surface it was a glorification, there was another way of reading it in which it appeared he was making fun of Keśava Mahārāj. Up until this time all the devotees there had been saying, “Look what he has written! What Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s disciple has written is really wonderful. Isn’t it great!” But Kṛṣṇa Dāsa Bābājī Mahārāj went and told Keśava Mahārāj, “Don’t you see what he has done?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Keśava Mahārāj replied, “His composition is very good.

No, Mahārāj!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Through everything he was always Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s eternal associate and constant companion. When Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would go to Māyāpur to visit Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj Prabhupāda, Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj would always be there. We have a picture in which Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj and Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj are sharing the same <span class=\\"e3\\">vyāsāsana</span> and at the microphone is Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj. He spoke on that day by the request of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj who was feeling unwell and therefore reluctant to speak."},{"class":"b51","text":" In his address Govinda Mahārāj quoted a verse spoken by Raghupati Upādhyāya."},{"class":"b59","text":" kaṁ prati kathayitum īśe,<br />samprati ko vā pratītim āyātu<br />go-pati-tanayā-kuñje,<br />gopa-vadhūṭī-viṭaṁ brahma"},{"class":"b54","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">(C.c.

In the words of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj: “Govinda Mahārāj’s contribution is very great.” The <span class=\\"e3\\">Paṇḍit-sabhā</span> presided over by Śrīla Guru Mahārāj gave Govinda Mahārāj various titles: one was <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhakti Śāstrī,</span> later to be followed by <span class=\\"e3\\">Upadeśaka Paṇḍit, Mahopadeśaka Paṇḍit,</span> and then <span class=\\"e3\\">Jyotirbhūṣaṇ Vidyā Rañjan.</span> One of his ornaments is Sanskrit <span class=\\"e3\\">alaṅkāra</span>—the knowledge of how to properly use the Sanskrit language. As Guru Mahārāj would contemplate different verses he was composing, Govinda Mahārāj would be with him suggesting various alternatives. Some of these verses were never published and some are no longer written down anywhere: at present they are only to be found within Govinda Mahārāj. It is very fortunate for us all that he not only remembers them but he can represent them very nicely."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj has said also that the relationship between the Guru and disciple is not limited to <span class=\\"e3\\">dāsya-rasa,</span> or the master and the servant, but there is also friendship, and in some cases even a sort of paternal feeling by the disciple towards the Guru in providing care and so forth. The reality is that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj were intimate friends. After all these years, distance was removed by their intimacy.

He grasped both of my shoulders very firmly and then started shaking my body with my head jostling about, and he said, “Goswāmī Mahārāj, this may be my last instruction to you...” The whole time he just kept on shaking me and he continued, “It is my sincere and earnest desire that you assist Govinda Mahārāj.

From so many ślokas of different sources we can see that service to the <span class=\\"e3\\">Vaiṣṇava</span> and Guru is our present life’s goal, and through that we must get direct service to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. But always our protector is our Guru—and my Guru’s protector is his Guru; his protector is his Guru, and in this way our Guru <span class=\\"e3\\">paramparā</span> is going up to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

But first we must become established in the plane of dedication, then we will have, gradually, the chance of service to Kṛṣṇa. It will come gradually—it may come sooner or it may take many births—but when it will come, it will come gradually. The main thing is service; but we cannot serve properly, therefore it is necessary to practise in order to prepare ourselves to engage in real service."},{"class":"b44","text":" At the present time we cannot do pure service and we cannot chant Kṛṣṇa’s Name properly.

When we have direct service, then there is no problem, and through my Guru it is possible. Gurudeva will take all responsibility, and only our duty will be to serve him, and that will be good for us. If he will give any responsibility, we are to fulfil that—and that is our duty. In a government, everybody does not do every type of work; but it runs by some doing some parts of the duties, and some doing other parts. Our concern is with the transcendental government and we are to make ourselves as parts of that government. Only this is the main thing. And chanting is necessary no doubt, but it is necessary to chant without offence, otherwise we shall be deprived of the main connection. Offenceless chanting and service will come gradually through the mercy of the Guru.

Similarly in the time of Śrīman Mahāprabhu you can remember reading the character of Murāri Gupta who was the close devotee of Śrī Rāmachandra. He worshipped Him in a temple which is still in Śrī Māyāpur. Also when Mahāprabhu went to preach in Dakṣiṇdeśa (South India), He met with many different kinds of devotees, but they were not all worshippers of Kṛṣṇa or even worshippers of any of the many different types of Kṛṣṇa <span class=\\"e3\\">Mūrtti.</span> In the time of Śrīman Mahāprabhu there were many examples and we can read about some of these in Śrī <span class=\\"e3\\">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> There also we find that many types of devotees could not be tolerated by Mahāprabhu but even they were harmonised by Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu and the other devotees.

Ousting or throwing out others is very easy, but engaging them for the service of Mahāprabhu is very hard. We see in the devotees’ nature so many different types of mentality, different types of activity, and different types of devotion, but a good manager or a good preacher must try in a harmonious way to engage them in the service of the Lord. This world where we live is actually the faulty plane: it is an illusory environment.

Many kinds of boys, girls, men, and women live in a family but the responsibility of the head of the family is to maintain everybody by teaching, supplying, and taking what is necessary for their benefit. The family head must do everything with full affection. He may sometimes chastise them, but behind is working the mood of affection."},{"class":"b44","text":" Under leadership and with the full, natural, willing service-energy of the local devotees it was possible to build up the mission there and in the future we are expecting to see there miracles.

He took <span class=\\"e3\\">sannyāsa</span> from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj but the <span class=\\"e3\\">jīva,</span> the soul, is independent. Kṛṣṇa does not interfere with that independence, therefore each <span class=\\"e3\\">jīva</span> has the freedom whether to go to hell or to heaven and that is the <span class=\\"e3\\">jīva’s</span> own responsibility. Kṛṣṇa can only search and cry for His lost servant.

In addition our one hundred percent attention must go there, and in that way we can develop our faithful service life. Chanting is essential. Chanting Śrī <span class=\\"e3\\">Harināma</span> is always beneficial for the conditioned souls but preaching to others gives us strength of devotional life and more and more opportunity to practice Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

One is service to the <span class=\\"e3\\">Vaiṣṇava</span> community in the local area by distributing books, preaching by lectures and other means, giving hospitality to the <span class=\\"e3\\">Vaiṣṇavas,</span> etc. And the second is direct service to this central Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh which, when far away, means helping with service donations, goods, etc. for the <span class=\\"e3\\">sevā</span> activities of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Maṭh.</span> This is very valuable service and very carefully we are always trying to please Śrī Śrī Guru-Gaurāṅga-Gāndharvvā-Govindasundarjīu in so many ways.

Its branches face downwards, that is, the demigods headed by Lord Brahmā are its branches, and it is endless for those persons who misuse the soul’s independence to adopt the life of <span class=\\"e3\\">karmma</span> or fruitive action—in this respect it is <span class=\\"e3\\">avyayam,</span> or indestructible; and yet, as far as devotionally orientated persons are concerned, it cannot remain even until the next day. In this respect it is ‘Aśvattha,’ which means, ‘perishable and transient.’ All the aphorisms of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Vedas</span> that promote fruitive action are represented as the protective leaves of that Aśvattha tree in the form of this material world.” One who knows in this way that tree representing the mundane world, such a person is a knower of the purport of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Vedas.</span>"},{"class":"b51","text":" Actually one who knows that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is coming down in this way can maintain his full faith with that and he can follow the conception of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj properly.

I know that there is no chance of any real servitor of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj leaving his service. If anyone has really seen and considered about the transcendental activities of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, he can easily understand that <span class=\\"e3\\">satyam, śivam</span> and <span class=\\"e3\\">sundaram</span> is Kṛṣṇa and our only duty is to serve Him. These mundane world’s difficulties always stay around us like the current of a river in which we, the souls, are being tossed about. We now have achieved this body which is like a boat and we are to carefully, without offence, cross over this troublesome river.

But we are to understand that there is another plane that is also reactionary: it is the world which opposes this mundane environment. It is called the world of renunciation, but through that ideal we cannot actually satisfy ourselves. It is the line between two planes and there birth and death are extremely absent, however if there is no transcendental service connection then it is not possible to go to the plane above that abscissa."},{"class":"b51","text":" Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī explained that we are to follow the middle path—<span class=\\"e3\\">yukta-vairāgya</span>—in which there is neither renunciation nor material attachment. With neither great attraction nor great repulsion we are to proceed without disturbance, and develop attachment to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. What will come easily by way of wealth and necessities we can accept, but it is not good for us to expend too much effort for anything of this material plane. Certainly Kṛṣṇa will provide according to our necessities and our allotted amount.
