That is not being a bold soldier of the saṅkīrtan party fearlessly wandering through the length and breadth of the world and chanting about Kṛṣṇa, about truth. Truth! Take up that missionary work, and māyā won’t venture to approach you, for māyā is misunderstanding. By repeating your Kṛṣṇa consciousness to others, you will generate the truthful consciousness. With the help of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you will be able to do away with everything infectious by spreading and distributing the disinfecting substances. That will be your duty. Be an agent of the disinfecting section who are throwing around the medicine to disinfect the infectious area. Be such an agent and thereby drive away infection from all around.

It will move in a circular way: what we receive as remuneration will be the tendency to produce more service to the object of our reverence. That is prema. Prema is not a separate thing from service, but it will help us more and more towards service. So, it is continuous; it is dynamic. It is not that, “I have acquired prema, now I am like a king and shall enjoy it—now there is no longer any necessity of service.” Such a stage will never come; rather, prema will promote the speed and quality of the service.

This is because such knowledge is meant for the higher level where there is no possibility of any deception. Whatever is said there is taken by the listeners as complete truth. There is no room for doubt because in that higher civilised plane, there is no possibility of any deception. The Upaniṣads say: “This means so and so”, and the natural response comes, “Yes, it is so.” There is no tarka (reasoning) and no doubt or anything of the kind because the very plane itself is such that deception is unknown. So, in the case of the Vedas and Upaniṣads, we are cautioned, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Achintyāḥ khalu ye bhāvā na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet</span>: don’t take your reasoning and doubt into that higher stage. It is unnecessary there where there is only plain speaking and fair dealing with no trouble from anyone wanting to deceive another. Deception and unfair dealings are unknown there.” This is the level of the Vedas and Upaniṣads where rhyme and reason are unnecessary. But in a lower stage, the smṛti and Purāṇas come to give their advice in another mood. The Purāṇas are like friends, advising, “Do this and you will be benefitted.” They give examples, “This person acted in such a way and received a good result, but this other did bad things and a bad result followed. So, my friend, please learn from this.” Then, the śruti comes to our help by showing us how to apply these truths in our everyday life."},{"class":"b44","text":" The kāvya also approaches us and comes in a very sweet manner like an affectionate wife to advise: “Do this, it will be very good for you.” But the Vedas take another approach, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Achintyāḥ khalu ye bhāvā na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet</span>: this subject matter does not come within the jurisdiction of doubt, reasoning, and so on. Don’t drag all these filthy things into such a sphere.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" In a lecture, I gave an example to illustrate this. A mother gives a sweet to her son. She puts it in his hand, but he says, “Oh, it may be poisoned! I must go to the laboratory and examine it.” It is a deplorable thing and a very low type of civilisation where such an attitude prevails. But in such a plane where affectionate and fair dealing is unknown, tarka, vichār, and yukti—doubt, examination, and inspection—are all present. But that is really a filthy life.

Fully risking everything, they have this highest standard of preparedness for the service of Kṛṣṇa—and that is the highest standard of life. In them, we find sacrifice to the extreme. Sacrifice for the good, sacrifice for the absolute good, the absolute beauty, bliss, and ecstasy. Your abode will be very near to Him according to your degree and intensity of sacrificing attitude. This is the close approach. By sacrifice we live. By enjoying we lose. By serving we thrive, and by enjoying we lose. And the position of renunciation is zero: no loss, no gain. But in comparison with the positive acquisition, it is loss. When there is no gain, then that is a loss.

Similarly, the soul’s position is independent. It is not dependent on material existence, but it thinks that material things are indispensably necessary to maintain its existence. But this is wrong and a concoction. To stand on a material conception is not necessary for the soul. Although that worldly conception seems to be so very indispensable for our being, it is not so. We are independent from matter. Even the mental existence is independent of this gross material existence, what to speak of that of the soul.

But the main point, the real substance of the transaction, will be to collect, cook, and offer to Him according to His will expressed in the scriptures. That is the first step, and only after the foodstuffs have been offered to Him shall we take anything ourselves. This will help to make us always conscious of why we are taking.

When I was at school, I had some appreciation for the students from East Bengal because I had heard from one of my cousins about their sacrifice for their country and so forth. So, during my college days, I would take my seat in that hostel where they generally lived. When I came in the association of the students there, I found there to be two sections. Many were studying medicine. If any patient was admitted or any other physical duty was required, one section would immediately run to meet those requirements. Another section was inclined to be engaged in meditation, chanting the Holy Names, doing sandhyā (worship), and so forth, but they would hate to attend to any patient or other such duties."},{"class":"b44","text":" My own nature was inclined to both kinds of duties, and when I was a fourth-year student, I suddenly met a boy from the first year who was similarly inclined.

That attracted me towards him, and I tried to gain his association."},{"class":"b44","text":" One morning we were going to the jungle to collect twigs in order to cleanse our teeth when in the course of our talk he said suddenly about his father. He referred to him as, “That gentleman”. I protested that it was disrespectful to use such a term for his respectable father. Then, he said, “Yes, I should not have mentioned in that way in your presence, but ultimately it is really so. Where was I in my previous lives? Only he is a ‘gentleman’ to me because it is only in this life that I have come in his house.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Somehow that touched a fine chord in me, and I began to think, “Yes, it is right. Nobody can stay here—not the father, the mother, the brothers, or even this house. Everything is temporarily connected, and I am wandering in eternity.” That sort of impression came in me in a very, very intense form, and the whole world became as if it was just empty—fully empty. At that time, that boy anyhow connected me with the life of Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" Presently, I was given a publication about Śrī Chaitanyadev by the gentleman who founded the Amrita Bazar Patrika newspaper. Into my thirsty mind, I drank fully the life of Mahāprabhu with much pleasure, and my attraction was drawn to Him. I also think that from my previous life there was some attraction. I found that my mother’s family had some connection with Mahāprabhu, but my father’s family were anti-Gaurāṅga. They were strictly smārta-brāhmaṇs, worshippers of the śakti, or goddess, and logicians of the nyāya school. But somehow, I had connection with Gaurāṅga, and then I came to want a good connection with His devotees. I searched for such a sādhu to accept as my Gurudev, but I was not satisfied, and in due course I went to study law in Kolkata. Then, leaving college, I joined with the non-cooperation movement of Gandhi. I joined temporarily because I considered that my fate was already tied with Mahāprabhu and therefore could not give anyone my whole life’s energy. After six years, the movement allowed me temporary leave."},{"class":"b44","text":" I was in search of a Gurudev. The founder of Bharat Seva Ashram was the same age as myself.

I answered him, “No, my head is already sold to Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He said, “Yes, I also recognise Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu to be the highest, but first it is necessary to follow the vairāgya, the indifference and renunciation of Buddha, then the discussion of the Vedānta of Śaṅkar, and after that the highest is the prema of Śrī Chaitanyadev. Without following each step, that prema would be misunderstood by the ordinary section.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He explained in that way, and of course I was very much pleased to hear him giving such position to Mahāprabhu. But I put to him this question: “You say that first we must pass through the stages given by Buddha and then Śaṅkar and only then come to Chaitanyadev, but Chaitanyadev did not say, ‘If you want to come to Me, come through Buddha and Śaṅkar and then to Me.’ Rather, He said, ‘Wherever you are, you can take the Name with the company of the sādhu and in that way you will come to Me.’ He did not say, ‘First become Buddhist, then become Śaṅkarite, and then you will come to Me.’ He did not say so.” He became silent."},{"class":"b44","text":" I asked him, “If you have some siddhi, you please say where is my Gurudev.” Then, he gave some idea: “Go to that particular gentleman.” By his request, I went there, but that man was not present.

I went to visit that place thinking that having the name ‘Gauḍīya’ they must have some connection with Śrī Chaitanyadev, and I found, “Yes, they are educated men.

We have no time to waste to hear all this.” But whenever there was reference to any scriptures, their reaction was, “Yes, what do you say? Please express it.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" What attracted me most was that they had within them such devout appreciation for the scriptures and for the ṛṣis, as was also in me, perhaps to an overflowing degree.

As a result, in his next life he received the body of a mango tree which bore many beautiful fruits, but not even a single bird would touch them. Then, one day Anantadev noticed the tree while on his way to see God.

With this also coming to my mind, I began in a mild way to help.

Anything can produce anything there in that original place!

In this mundane plane, inspiration draws us towards different stages of enjoying spirit. That vibration comes from innumerable local centres of local interest. Also, in the attraction to the Centre, there are many stages, but that vibration is from the Nārāyaṇ Centre, the Rāma Centre, the Kṛṣṇa Centre—all in consonance with the main Centre.

A hypnotist can normally only hypnotise within the range of his senses, but it may sometimes be possible also that from afar one can inspire, hypnotise, and engage another as a medium.

But in previous days, such communication was psychic, so ordinary people could not know how it was being done. We also tend to think it is impossible, even though now it is physically possible by telephone to talk with others in America and London. Such modern communication is also a miracle.

And all the big Indian yogīs themselves say, and stand as proof, that so many wonderful things can be achieved only by improving psychic powers. They used to communicate with even the demigods.

So, those Russian gentlemen came here with the enquiry: “We have come with some material object, to see if we can utilise the speed of mind in the case of scientific research.” But finally they said, “No, we could not do it.

In those books, there is much mentioned about the present- day scientific advancement, so the later generations will read that there used to be aeroplanes, buses, and so many things. But after the nuclear war, those future generations of crippled persons will not be able to understand that such things really existed.

Our minds are not sufficiently developed to be able to detect that, but if they were, we would be able to see: “Oh! Devarṣi Nārad has come.” The impression in the mind’s eye would be able to detect when such as Devarṣi, Vyāsadev, Mahāprabhu, or Nityānanda Prabhu would come here.

But this is an extreme example to show how much care and attention must be paid to save and protect the materials to be used in the service of Kṛṣṇa, even if that should make Him dissatisfied for the time being."},{"class":"b52","text":" Everything is meant for Kṛṣṇa, so we must preserve and take care of everything. “For the time being, Kṛṣṇa may be a little dissatisfied, but what does it matter? I need to look after His service materials.” That should be our tendency, and it is a very fine, very subtle thing to detect and understand. What is the underlying tendency? We must have the mood that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, and at the cost of the present, the future must be kept up. “At present, we may suffer, but we must still store for our future.” When this sort of tendency is in the interest of Kṛṣṇa, it is to be appreciated. So, we are to engage in jñāna-śūnyā-bhakti—service with no mood of curiosity. It is not that we shall want to be a big word-juggler, yogī, jñānī, or any type of ‘big’ person. But we shall feel satisfied if we have the chance to lead even a half-educated forest life, but as humble servants of the gopīs. Such humility—and not grandeur—satisfies Kṛṣṇa most. Grandeur may be adored in Vaikuṇṭha, but it is ignored in Vṛndāvan Dhām. The Vṛndāvan Pastimes are simple, plain, and ordinary—neither high nor low—but a golden average. The degree of meanness can be infinite. The degree of nobleness and grandness can also be infinite. But the middle point, we may say, is the golden mean. Love is there. Love does not want to see into the future, but only the present—the concentrated present. Love. For love, we may risk the whole future and may not care at all about the past. “Act. Act in the living present.” Grandness and reverence are not very suitable for love.

Anaṅga Mañjarī is the manifestation of Baladev through whom He is represented in madhura-rasa. The science of rasa does not allow Baladev to enter there with His own abhimāna, mood; therefore, we are told that He has to go there as Anaṅga Mañjarī. The laws of rasa are of such fine importance.

He explained that by this statement, Nityānanda Prabhu has come to the relief of the most sinful and heinous. They have no other method to come to divinity, but Nityānanda Prabhu has opened a way for them: they are being punished by His devotee, and so Kṛṣṇa’s special attraction will be drawn towards them. Kṛṣṇa’s attraction will be there because apparently His child, His devotee, has done something wrong, so He will come to compensate for that. If punishment is given by His devotee to a member of the public, Kṛṣṇa’s special attention will be drawn to that man to compensate. He has tolerated, and by way of compensation he will be benefitted. Vṛndāvan Dās has given them some punishment and dishonour; they are mortified, so they must be taken in, and some special grace will come to them.

So, there is no permanent apathy, jealousy, or any spirit of revenge, but rather, any connection that comes in any way is only of compassionate temperament to draw him forwards. Of course, that does not mean that willfully we should offend the devotee and try to get benefit thereby! That will be aparādh.

Come through them, and do not seek any recommendation from outside to use various means to try to force Me to favour you. That is not the proper path, but come to Me through My own agents. They have no aspiration to fulfil for themselves. They are all-given to My service, and they are wandering trying to recruit persons, to benefit them. So, come through My agents, never otherwise. What is yoga? There is air and there are so many things, but by controlling those do you think you will force Me to come to you? I am the Absolute Autocrat. I don’t care for anything else. I have no necessity to care for anything else. Not any force, any tactics, any cunning methods, any canvassing—nothing can influence Me. I am the Autocrat. And admitting the line of autocracy, try to come to Me. There are many demigods. They are making trade, but I am not amongst the commodities of their trading. None can make trade with Me. I am Absolute. I look only for devotion, exclusive devotion which is not formal, but natural, hearty, and sincere. I look for that.

A struggle presupposes something: its aim and object, its purpose. So, what is the aim of that struggle?"},{"class":"b44","text":" The German philosopher, Hegel, has given his philosophy called ‘Ideal Realism’. He says that the ideal is not unreal or abstract imagination but is real and all-important, whereas the material body is nothing. Rather, it is only a servant to obey the dictation of the ideal. First, there is the idea, then the body follows after it. So, the ideal is real. This philosophy was put forward by Hegel."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, ‘struggle’, but struggle for what? A struggle may be of two types. First is the case where there is no taste for mundane enjoyment or renunciation, but there is the desire for something unknown but at least above these two aims of life. If the person feels, “I can’t tolerate the world of enjoyment, but also I dislike renunciation”, then it is presupposed that he has some previously acquired sukṛti, devotional credit, in the background. From his subconscious region will come the desire, the struggle, for the company of a sādhu, a good agent, a good master who can help him. He will feel, “I am in a vacant position. I want some shelter. Who is there who can give me shelter? Who can save Me?” He may feel this sort of uneasiness: both dissatisfaction with the present, and also no sight of any positive engagement in the future. Yet he is unconsciously wanting something. To have this hankering for something positive presupposes some sukṛti. This is one type of struggle."},{"class":"b44","text":" Another is where there is no positive aim but only the aim to get out of the undesirable negative side. This desire for renunciation—to enter samādhi and be reduced to zero, to be finished—is like committing suicide. Just as when a person who cannot tolerate an unfavourable situation feels, “I cannot maintain my life any more”, and so commits physical suicide; similarly, renunciation is spiritual suicide. He feels, “I have no taste for this mundane world where there is always struggling amongst so many transient things. I have no prospect here.” Feeling in this way, he desires to enter into samādhi. This is like putting a living man into a tomb and then sealing it up. But if one is neither satisfied here in the temporary mundane world, nor wants to commit suicide and so efface his existence, then if he is even subconsciously hankering for some bright life, it means that sukṛti is underground within the foundation of his subconsciousness. After that, some sādhu may come to visit him and give him some good news and instructions, “Do this, do that.” He will have some tendency to follow that advice, and from that stage gradually his positive life begins."},{"class":"b44","text":" There is an example in one godbrother. When he was a boy of perhaps eighteen or so, he was dissatisfied with his existing life within his family household, so he went to Jagannāth Purī. Within his mind and from the bottom of his heart, he wanted to find the association of a sādhu and join with him. At that time, our Guru Mahārāj was in Purī, and one of his followers, who was a very learned and clever man, met him and asked, “You are a very simple boy. Why have you come here?” “I have come in search of a sādhu.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" “Oh, then come with me!” He took him to the camp of our Śrīla Prabhupād, and he joined. The acquisition from his former life was such that when he went to search for the positive spiritual path, he easily found it, and so he joined, and joined forever. He joined at the age of eighteen years and received sannyās at twenty-eight. But before accepting sannyās, someone had discouraged him saying, “You are so young, and it is not sure how long you will live, so to take so much risk is not very wise!” He was also hesitating and said, “Prabhupād has proposed this, but I am hesitating, and some of my friends are also misleading me.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" I put it to Śrīla Prabhupād that he was hesitating.

Don’t have any apprehension. All fear is confined here in this plane, but you are going to take shelter above this area of fear. You want to enter into the fearless area; you are going to connect with the fearless world. Rather, this world is the fearful place!” This came from his mouth. At last he accepted, and his sannyās was given by Prabhupād in Purī. Every day in the morning for about a month, he used to sing Śrīla Prabhupād’s favourite bhajan: <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī Pada</span>.

Honey is found here in this lower plane, but nectar is only of our imagination. We have no experience of nectar in the mundane world; its character is transcendental.

His mother may call him by a sound not fully according to that word’s pronunciation, but that does not detract anything. Her affection is all-in-all. If a mother calls her child by a name, the name may not be pronounced in the perfectly correct way, but the affection behind her calling his name is more valuable.

That sincere cooperation from the heart is necessary for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that can purify very quickly. To have faith that this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness will purify us is the minimum demand. One must think, “If I attain this, everything will be done.” If such a sort of generous, wide conviction is there within us along with a sincere mood of cooperation, then that can help us very quickly.

I must be faithful to my own self. I feel that I am uneasy here in this world, and I must search for some home comfort. If I am sincere, I know that the way forward will be open to me, and that it is not difficult; it is there in the sound aspect of the Supreme. That greatest reality is Himself present also within the divine sound. This divine sound is not an imaginary thing even though to my present conception it is coming and going, appearing and disappearing.

Otherwise, save yourself first and do as much as possible within the circumstances with the policy of ‘making the best of a bad bargain’. When the special will of the Lord will come to devour the whole and change the people’s hearts wholesale, then the circumstances will be otherwise. But at present, first save yourself, and then do as much as is possible to make progress and be satisfied with that. Just fighting is not necessary, but to keep up the very life, that is necessary.

We won’t go to attack from this side, but if it is more suitable to attack from the other side or from the rear, then we can prepare our army there.

Everywhere on every side of you there is demand, so you can go on distributing where it is necessary and favourable—not that leaving a particular group who are demanding, you will select one particular place only and go there. Only if your energy is overflowing, then you can go. Otherwise, there are so many places where you can distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so utilise yourself there—that is to make the best of a bad bargain.

We are not to specifically invite a fight, and also we are not to only avoid it. The middle course will always be helpful for us. We are not to lose our energy—to waste it only for fighting—but it is necessary for us to give the positive thing and engage our energy there. If we can give a thing to the left side, why should we be determined to go to the right side and thereby waste our energy?

We should have no prejudice for anything. Unprejudiced, we shall only engage in the positive line—in that way we shall move. We should live for the positive interest, and not for the love of any negative things such as, “I love to fight with the enemies.” To fight with the enemies, that is one thing, and to distribute nectar to the public at large is another. In order to do that, you must first know the proper conception and all the circumstances yourself, and only then try to give that to others. No false representation will be helpful.

At the same time, we must not be trespassers and on the way take things that are meant for Kṛṣṇa, for that will make us traitors, unfaithful servants."},{"class":"b61","text":" kibā vā karite pāre\\tkāma-krodha sādhakere<br />\\tyadi haya sādhu-janāra saṅga"},{"class":"b43","text":" Narottam Dās Ṭhākur said, “If we have the favour of the great personages, then what can such types of temptation do to us? They can’t do anything. If we work under our guardian and he is very careful, very strong, and very judicious, then no temptation can do any harm to us.” This attitude is the key to the success of life. Generally, according to our capacity, we shall try to move in this way, and at the same time we shall keep in our mind that to attain to our highest position it is necessary to be able to deal with all the serious things, even the most serious; otherwise, there will be some defect in us. Wholesale conversion must come within us that we are servitors and not masters. This is the case with fame also. Name and fame, pratiṣṭhā, is the most subtle, most dangerous enemy. It is the highest enemy, and at the same time it is the most subtle. Pratiṣṭhā, to take name, fame, and credit for one’s own self without giving it to Gurudev, is the greatest enemy there is, and it is very difficult to detect."},{"class":"b50","text":" Three things in particular are very dangerous for the devotees: kanak, kāminī, and pratiṣṭhā—money, women, and fame."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Devotee:</span> How can we detect pratiṣṭhā within ourselves?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Guru Mahārāj:</span> That comes with the development of internal perfection and our continuous thankfulness to Gurudev. It is necessary to understand and feel that everything comes from above: “I have nothing. I have no position, and therefore my present situation always depends on the mercy of my Gurudev. It may be withdrawn from me at any moment. Whatever I may have is not a fixed thing in me. It is not as a matter of right but is only extended grace in me. The moment it is withdrawn, I am nowhere. It is all Kṛṣṇa’s svarūp-śakti. I am taṭasthā-śakti and have no capital. I am working on the capital of my master. I have no capital of my own.” We must be able to remain on such a plane of thinking and realise that, “Without his help, without his grace, I am in darkness. My fate is dark. As long as he extends his grace in me, I can see. If the light is withdrawn, the eye is helpless.” We are to realise the position that it is not our birth-right. By our birth, we are taṭasthā-śakti, marginal potency, and whatever we have found, it is the gracious extension of svarūp-śakti in us. Our Guru and the Vaiṣṇavas are the proprietors. It is their wealth and property; it all belongs to them."},{"class":"b51","text":" At the same time, it never occurs that the Guru and Vaiṣṇavas withdraw their grace from the faithful. Such cruel activity can never be seen; rather, they are busy to extend their circle, and they never withdraw—that is our solace, our consolation. But it is not a matter of right that we can make some demand. There must be no demand and no challenge. The challenging spirit towards the Vaiṣṇavas must be eliminated forever. We are living on their grace, their prasād.

We are to accept those remnants and continue our lives in that way without any rights or demands. This is similar to Āryan saṁskṛti, Indian custom. Hindu law gives no rights or position to the females. The whole right is with the men and nothing with the women, but by their affection and serving spirit, the women hold the whole respect—the key to all respect.

They have no external right and do not care for any. They are His, but only through the power of affection and loving service, they command the whole. The potency aspect of Kṛṣṇa does not want any right, force, or power, yet they have the subtlemost power: the power of affection, the power of love, the power of service, and that is considered to be the highest power ever known to the world. Give up your legal power or any physical power; the śakti (potency) is such that it does not care for that."},{"class":"b44","text":" The respected Ashutosh Mukherjee was several times wanted by the government to go to England, but his mother did not give permission.

Taking the feet dust of the mother, the son feels he can do anything and everything. Affection and love have such power, such value! Therefore, Mahāprabhu says, “To give this and that to God is self-deception. Give love. Love of Kṛṣṇa, prema, is everything; it is all-in-all. You are spending money and giving your physical energy in so many ways, but love is the real essence of any existence, so offer that to the Lord and through that come to the plane of love that surrounds Him.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" God takes the form of Kṛṣṇa in the plane of love, and that is the most fundamental and the most subtle plane behind all this variegated creation.

Anyhow try to have admission in that plane, and you will find there the happiest form of life."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mercy is more beautiful than justice. We cannot think of blaming the spirit of justice, but at the same time we cannot deny that there is mercy over justice. But one who can extend mercy over justice must have such power that he is able to give due compensation. The Lord has such power of compensation. Kṛṣṇa is such an aspect of the Lord. He can give mercy through love and affection, and by any means we want to live in that environment. Mahāprabhu came to show that to be the plane for which we should strive. And Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur said, “In no time, the intelligentsia of the world will come to understand that this is the highest conception of attainment of all humans as well as of everything else in the whole of creation. The intelligentsia cannot be misguided for long by so many other proposals of the highest attainment which are only giving partial achievement. Many things are going on in religion in the name of the highest solution of our life, but what Mahāprabhu has given very soon will be detected by the intelligentsia of the world, and all will flock to the banner of Śrī Chaitanyadev and will sing the glory of Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa.”"},{"class":"b52","text":" What do you think?
