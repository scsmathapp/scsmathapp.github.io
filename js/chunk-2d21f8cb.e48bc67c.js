The basis of all things material is consciousness, which is spiritual. Consciousness can contact consciousness directly. When consciousness comes into the stage of matter, material conception, we experience a kind of vague consciousness; first there is hazy consciousness and then material consciousness. But everything has its spiritual side. And as eternal souls, our direct connection is really only with the conscious aspect of existence. For example, the earth is conceived of as a woman. According to the Vedas, the presiding deity of the earth is a woman. And the sun is conceived of as a devatā, a male god."},{"class":"b51","text":" The soul, coming into material consciousness, must come through some hazy reflection of consciousness, chidābhās.

When consciousness is coming to the material world to know the material world, it has to first pass through material consciousness, and then it can feel what is matter. According to Darwin’s theory, matter gradually produces consciousness, but before producing consciousness it must produce some hazy consciousness; then mind and then the soul. But in reality, it is just the opposite. So, subjective evolution parallels objective or material evolution. But in the evolution of consciousness, the supersubject is first, then the individual soul or jīva-subject is next. Then, from the subjective consciousness of the jīvas, matter is produced. But consciousness must penetrate hazy consciousness to perceive matter."},{"class":"b44","text":" I say that the process of evolution moves from the top downward. The Absolute Reality—if we at all assert that there is anything which is the absolute reality—must possess two qualifications. What is that? First, in the words of Hegel, He must be by Himself: He is His own cause. Second—and more important to us—He is for Himself: He exists to fulfil His own purpose. He is not subservient to any other entity for then His position would be secondary. Reality the Absolute is full in Himself. All other things are coming from Him. The perfect substance already exists. What appears to us as imperfect comes down according to our own defective senses."},{"class":"b51","text":" The imperfect must be dependent upon the perfect, the ultimate reality. And the imperfect may be so arranged by Him in order to prove His perfection. To prove the perfection of the Absolute, there is conditioned and unconditioned, finite and infinite reality. The defective world, therefore, has an indirect relation to the truth. However, consciousness cannot jump at once into the conception of matter; it must pass through a process to come to material consciousness. From the marginal position, from the verge of the higher eternal potency, evolution and dissolution of this material world begins. This takes place only on the outskirts of svarūp-śakti, which is the system responsible for the evolution of the spiritual plane and is an eternally evolving dynamic whole. It is not that nondifferentiation is the origin of differentiation. An eternally differentiated substance exists. That plane is filled with līlā, dynamic Pastimes. If a static thing can be conceived of as eternal, then why can’t a dynamic thing be conceived of as eternal? That plane of svarūp-śakti is fully evolved within. It is eternal. Evolution and dissolution concern only the degradation of the subtle spirit to the gross material platform and his evolution towards perfection. Here, there is evolution and dissolution, but these things do not exist in the eternal abode of svarūp-śakti."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Dr. Singh:</span> Objective evolution is what modern science calls Darwinian evolution, but how does subjective evolution unfold in Kṛṣṇa conscious science?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj:</span> You have to take the example of hypnotism. Through a form of mystic ‘hypnotism’, the supersubject controls the subject to see a particular thing, and he is bound to see that. One may think that as we see a stone, the stone compels us to see it as stone, but it is just the opposite: we are compelled to see it as stone being under the influence of the supersubject who displays everything as He likes. When He commands, “See stone”, then we shall see stone. Full control over whatever we see rests in His hands. No power to control what we see rests in the objective world. The objective world is fully controlled by the subjective. This is confirmed in <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, where Kṛṣṇa says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Paśya Me yogam aiśvaram</span>: if I say, ‘Behold my mystic power’, you are bound to see it.

What is meant by this statement of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Gītā</span> concerns this brahmāṇḍa, this material world. The gist of this statement is that from the lower planetary systems up to the highest—this entire area of evolution and dissolution—everything is manipulated by Him. No credit can be attached to any external thing. All credit should go to the Centre who controls everything."},{"class":"b44","text":" And reality is subjective. It is based on consciousness. Colour is perceived through the eye. It is not that the colour is there and the eye can catch it. But the seer sees through the eye and perceives colour. So colour is a perception. Its position as actual substance should be traced to the subtle plane of existence. This is the nature of reality: the gross is coming from the subtle. In sāṅkhya philosophy, of course, that is described as a bifurcated thing. According to sāṅkhya philosophy, there are three branches of reality: the sense, the senses, and the sense objects. Sound is created by the ear, colour is produced by the eye, and so on."},{"class":"b44","text":" The objects of the senses are in the mode of ignorance, tama-guṇa, the sensual instruments are in the mode of passion, raja-guṇa, and the power of sensation is in the mode of goodness, sattva-guṇa.

So the gross world is coming from the subtle through the channel of consciousness. The feeler, the instrument of perception, is creating the object of his perception."},{"class":"b51","text":" Try to understand this principle of hypnotism.

The eternal aspect of the absolute whole is divided in three ways: energy, consciousness, and ecstasy. Thinking, willing, and feeling. Sat, chit, ānanda. Sat, the potency for maintaining existence, is the potency of Baladev (bala). Chit, the aspect of consciousness, is Vāsudev (jñān). And ānanda, ecstatic feeling, is Rādhikā (kriyā). Jñān, bala, kriyā (knowledge, strength, feeling); sat, chit, ānanda (eternity, cognition, bliss); sandhinī, samvit, hlādinī (existence, realisation, ecstasy): Baladev, Kṛṣṇa, Rādhārāṇī. These are the three phases of Advaya-jñān, or the one whole. The one whole can be thought of in its primary, evolved stage in three ways: main consciousness, main energy, and main satisfaction.

Once, I considered from this point of view the question of the planets in Vedic cosmology. We see that by the movement of the different planets a solar eclipse is caused by the moon’s shadow falling upon the Earth. And yet in the scriptures it has been described that, during an eclipse, the planet Rāhu is devouring the sun or the moon. When Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur was in Purī during his last days and an eclipse came, one devotee who was supposed to know siddhānta, the conclusions of scripture, was sitting next to Prabhupād. He suddenly ridiculed the idea given in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> that during a solar or lunar eclipse Rāhu devours the sun or moon."},{"class":"b44","text":" I could not tolerate that such a remark should be passed in regard to the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> and argued that what <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> has stated is not to be taken lightly. I offered what seemed like some far-fetched support. I said that in his <span class=\\"e3\\">Jaiva-dharma</span>, Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur has created so many characters, but I think that they are not imaginary. What he has written might have occurred during some other millennium (kalpa), or day of Brahmā, and that has now come to the surface. In this way I went on to support the cosmological position of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> by arguing that what is necessary to prove reality must also have some real position. It cannot but be. In this way my argument went, and Prabhupād supported me."},{"class":"b44","text":" In understanding the position of the planet Rāhu, what Śukadev and Vyāsadev have said is geographically impossible, but their statements are there in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, and the literal meaning of the scriptures is not to be taken lightly. Considering the importance of the literal meaning of scripture, Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj presented <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> <span class=\\"e3\\">As It Is</span>.

I have faith in that.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" There are so many statements on the cosmology of the universe in the scriptures. The Aryans, the spiritually developed men of former times, used to see everything as consciousness. They saw that the shadow is also conscious. The shadow, ābhās, is also considered to be a stage of consciousness. Only through that shadowy stage of consciousness can we come to the material conception of a thing. Before we reach the conception of a shadow, we must pass through some mental stage, and personification may be attached to that mental stage. The personification of the shadow may be referred to as ‘Rāhu’."},{"class":"b44","text":" The soul approaches matter, the material world, but before that, he must pass through a shadowy stage of consciousness called chidābhās. Consciousness passes through the shadow level of consciousness into matter, non-consciousness. And that shadow stage of consciousness has its personality. It is also conscious, and may be known as ‘Rāhu’."},{"class":"b44","text":" Every material conception presupposes a spiritual conception of that particular thing. The shadow through which consciousness must pass in order to perceive things as material has personality, and in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span>, the ṛṣis, the seers of the truth, are addressing it as Rāhu. Because they are highly developed, they find the personal aspect of existence everywhere. What we perceive to be dead matter, they perceive to be conscious. Therefore, they always take the personal perspective."},{"class":"b44","text":" The soul, when going to experience any material conception, will have to pass through a medium which influences his consciousness to see things as material. What is concrete matter is unknown. It is a mere effect of consciousness. As everything material must have some conscious origin, or origin in personal consciousness, there must be a personal conception of the sun, the moon, the earth, and all the planets. Before we reach the conception of a shadow or any other object, the soul has to pass through a conscious stage. That stage has some spiritual existence as a person. Therefore, the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> refers to the sun, the moon, and the planet Rāhu, as persons. Everything—the earth, the moon , the stars, the planets—has a personal conception. In the background of what we can perceive with our dull senses, everything that is said to be matter, there must be a personal conception. Without the influence of a personal conception, consciousness cannot reach the stage of gross matter."},{"class":"b51","text":" Therefore, in the ancient scriptures we find that the great sages and ṛṣis are always addressing everything within this world as a person. Although to us it is dead matter, they have considered them as persons. Why? The matter is rather the shadow of the personal entity. The personal, conscious entity is more real, and the matter we perceive through dimmed consciousness is less real."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Dr. Murphey:</span> So, that shadow is Rāhu?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj:</span> When we conceive of the personal representation of that shadow, it will be known as Rāhu. Everything is conscious. The shadow, its effect—everything."},{"class":"b44","text":" When the moon is between the sun and the earth, the shadow of the moon is coming here, and what is coming is also conscious. Everything is conscious first—then there is matter. From the personal conception things evolve to gross consciousness. It is all personal. So, the ṛṣis with such a vision of reality used to address everything as a person: the trees, the mountains, the sun, the moon, the ocean. When pure consciousness is coming to experience pure matter, then there must first be some mixed stage, and that is a person suffering in karma. Person means they are not a fully developed spiritual person at present, but in a mixed condition. So, what the ṛṣis are saying—that everything is a person—is real; it is not a concoction."},{"class":"b51","text":" Everything is conscious. As the present scientists say everything is matter, we have real cause to think that everything is conscious. Whatever you see does not matter; we can directly feel what is in our nature. That is conscious. Our consciousness may be in a developed or degraded position, but consciousness is nearer to us. We feel our mental energy only."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Dr. Murphey:</span> This is a bit difficult for us to fully grasp.

Otherwise, there is no possibility of its being reflected into this plane as matter. First, there is consciousness, and then when it is in a more gross condition, it appears to be matter. In the study of ontology, it is taught that when studying a particular thing, although we can know that it has certain attributes to the eye and that it appears to the ear in a particular way, these are all appearances. Independent of appearances, the ontological aspect of a thing—what it is, the reality of a thing—is unknown and unknowable. My contention is that when consciousness is going to feel non-conscious matter, it will have to pass through a conscious area to meet the material object. So, the full perception of that material thing cannot but be conscious, and consciousness always indicates person. First, there is conception and then the material idea."},{"class":"b51","text":" The conscious world is very near and the material world is very far off. Therefore, the great ṛṣis, whose thinking is highly developed, address whatever they find within the environment as if they are all persons.

And when the subject is coming to the more distant area to conceive of matter, that will be the farthest point from him. He will address everything by which he is surrounded with personal conceptions."},{"class":"b44","text":" A personal conception cannot but assert that matter is far off. The direct connection of consciousness is with the shadow, the reflection of the material into the conscious world. The soul can understand that only. If matter can exist independently, then also matter has a shadow in the conscious world, and the soul is concerned with that shadow."},{"class":"b44","text":" In other words, there is the person and then the body. Just as the body is the after-effect of the conscious living agent, matter is the after-effect of spirit. Irrespective of all material consciousness, that which is in direct contact with soul is all personal. Chidābhās is something like the mental substance we have within."},{"class":"b51","text":" There are two kinds of persons, kṣara and akṣara: the pure liberated soul and the soul who is struggling in matter. When liberated and non-liberated persons are mixed within the world of material transactions, whether as moving or non-moving entities, or whatever their position might be, still they should be considered persons. Since everything is a unit of consciousness, everything has personal existence."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Dr. Murphey:</span> So, externally we see the Ganges as water, but in reality she is a person."},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj:</span> Everything is a person.

But they are all conscious: the Yamunā river, the cows, the trees, the fruit—everything is conscious, spiritual, but they pose in different ways. Being able to detect the conscious characteristic in everything, the Aryans saw all of nature as conscious and personal and addressed everything as conscious."},{"class":"b51","text":" Consciousness and personality are the universal basis of reality. Whatever we may experience is conscious. The reflection of a material object is within me, and the plane within me is conscious.

What is ātmā, the soul, the spiritual conception? We have come to the world conception by a particular process. By the process of elimination we can trace out what the mind is. It is said that the basis of the mind is acceptance and rejection: saṅkalpa-vikalpa—“I want this, I don’t want that.’’ What is the mind? A thing that contains apathy and sympathy for the external world. That is the mind. We have to trace within us what that thing is. It is within us, and one has to enter into his own self and try to have some personal experience of what the mind is. Then by internal analysis one can try to come directly in touch with the faculty of judgment, reason, intelligence, by asking, “What is intelligence?

The deviation from our normal spiritual condition, the development of misconception, is based on the charm—the prospect—of separate interest. That is the root cause of all misunderstanding. The conception of local, provincial interest has caused the difference between a proper conception of reality and misconception. We have gone away from the central conception. From universal consciousness we have come to this provincial plane. And according to the gradation of consciousness in its development from provincial to universal, we may find ourselves in so many different planets or planes of existence: Bhū, Bhuva, Sva, Jana, Maha, Tapa, Satya; all these different stages of development are involved in this process of provincialism and universalism.

Adjustment is life; it is liberated life, and to be the prey of maladjustment is to approach pain and misery. Everything within the environment is all right.

But still, He is our friend. We should not forget that. We are represented in Him. Our detachment from Him is the cause of all the miseries that we are suffering. We and others like us have lost faith in Him, but He is our friend. We are jealous of Him and are thinking, “I am not the master? Someone else is the master—this is intolerable. No taxation without representation!” But our interests are well-represented in Kṛṣṇa. He cares about us even more than we can conceive.

Rather, those material attachments are dragging us back towards the wrong thing. And as a result, we can’t allow our mind to be attracted to Kṛṣṇa. The things of this world, or attachments, are all negative; these things are all our enemy. The whole universe may be burned to ashes, but we will not be affected in any way. The world may be devastated—the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars—everything may vanish, but still we remain. The soul is eternal. And if we can have a connection with Kṛṣṇa, the things of this world are all unnecessary for us and for everyone else.

The light revealed a substance like water."},{"class":"b44","text":" That primal light is compared with personality. Light means consciousness, and consciousness means personality. That light, or personality, first gave birth to the onlookers to the feelers of material existence, and then to an objective substance like water. That water is known as Virajā, or causal substance. What is known in Vaiṣṇava vocabulary as Brahmaloka—the world of consciousness—is represented by light, and Virajā, or causal substance, is represented by water. The conscious world is represented by light, and the first objective reality is represented as water. Then, the seeds of consciousness are sown in the causal water which is the shadow of that light. Although the actual element of water was created long after this, the first conception of matter is compared to water because water is an accommodating, moving solution. The Sanskrit word for water, <span class=\\"e3\\">apa</span>, means “of lower conception”. In this way, the lower creation began."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, in connection with the seeds of consciousness and the primal water, the next production was known as mahat-tattva: the energy of consciousness represented by light mixed with matter as a mass.

There are twenty-four elements. The self, three subtle elements—prakṛti, mahat-tattva, and ahaṅkār, five gross elements, five senses, five sense objects, five sense-gathering instruments—in this way, the development of the material world has been described to have come down through a process of subtle to gross, from consciousness to matter.

And the conjugal mellow can be subdivided into svakīya, wedded love, and parakīya, a paramour relationship. This is, of course, a very elevated subject matter. Still, we have to have some view of these things since our fate is ultimately connected with such high things given to us by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu and great Āchāryas like Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur and discussed in scriptures like <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> and <span class=\\"e3\\">Chaitanya-charitāmṛta</span>."},{"class":"b51","text":" What is found in their teachings about Goloka is our prospect, our aspiration.

Consciousness and prakṛti, the most primitive conceptions of energy, are categorically different. The conglomerate consciousness comes in contact with mass energy, and as they mingle together, a general ego evolves. That general ego gradually dissolves into innumerable egos, and the conglomerate consciousness distributes itself as individual units of consciousness absorbed in material energy. In this way, gradually, the individual conditioned souls come down and are entangled within the material world."},{"class":"b44","text":" In a primitive state when the individual souls are massed together as a common whole, the conglomerate false ego, or ahaṅkāra, is known as mahat-tattva. As it evolves, it differentiates into innumerable individual units. Just as an atom can be broken down into subatomic particles, electrons, protons, neutrons, and so on, the conglomerate ego gradually breaks into its component individual egos, jīva-souls. Their position is taṭastha, marginal, and undetectable. From that subtle, undetectable plane of marginal energy, consciousness first develops into the detectable plane as a whole, and then innumerable individual spiritual units are manifest from that mass lump of ego, or mahat-tattva. Gradually, the other elements of creation develop within this negative plane of exploitation."},{"class":"b44","text":" This world is sometimes pushing forth, and sometimes withdrawing. In the same way that the heart expands and contracts again and again, the whole universe expands and contracts. Regrouping within the one, and again manifest as the many—the one and the many—the evolution and dissolution of the material universe takes place. As a heart expands and contracts, the whole universe is manifest and withdrawn."},{"class":"b44","text":" The same characteristics that we find in the smallest unit can be traced in the bigger units.

But accepting that the soul is in the background, prakṛti or material energy—the body—works on its behalf. The relationship between body and soul is like the relationship between a minor and his false guardians.

In ignorance, I was considering that this perishable body and this flickering mind were my true self. But the material senses and mind are all trespassers. They have some inimical tendency towards my true self. I am soul. I have no necessity of all these things. Without these unnecessary material things I can live! No food is necessary for the soul from the jurisdiction of this material plane. The soul is independent. What a wonderful existence I have! In reality I am soul, and the nature of the soul is so noble, so high, so good.” A diametrical change of consciousness comes at this point and one tries to enter into that higher realm. Spiritual reality is what is necessary for us. We are soul, we are independent of matter. We are made of such transcendental existence. Nothing can threaten the soul’s existence—not the atomic bomb, nuclear war, lightning, thunder, or earthquakes. All the troubles of this material world are limited to this body which is a foreign carcass, a concocted representation of my true self. My true self exists on the spiritual plane, on a higher level. If we can really have a touch of that realisation, a glimpse of our own identity—if we can feel within that the soul is independent of matter—then a revolutionary change will take place within our minds. Then, our attempt to progress in spiritual life becomes quite genuine. Otherwise, our progress is suspicious, doubtful. We grasp it intellectually and think, “Yes, let me try. I’m hearing, of course, that I have a good prospect in spiritual life; by my intelligence I can follow something. Let me try.” But progress on the intellectual plane is only hesitating progress. When one comes to the plane of one’s own soul, however, one will find one’s self and realise, “Here I am!” At that time all false conceptions which have been held for so long will vanish like a dream. They will all be finished, and one will think, “I’m to start a new life.” And the new prospect will open to make progress in the higher plane."},{"class":"b44","text":" Soul is nearby. We can try to find out what the soul is if we can eliminate the material elements. This is the process of the Upaniṣads and is mentioned in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā </span>(3.42): <span class=\\"e3\\">indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur</span>. First we are to understand that our senses are primary. If my senses are removed, the entire world of our experience is nothing to me. Only through my senses can I be aware of the existence of the outside world. Minus senses, eyes, ears, no world is apparent to me. Then, above the senses is the mind. What is the mind? The mind deals with acceptance and rejection: saṅkalpa-vikalpa. In other words, the mind thinks, “I want this; I don’t want that.” It deals with attachment and hatred. The mind determines who is enemy and who is friend. “This is mine, that’s yours.” If we want to understand the mind, we have to look within, to enquire within: what is that element in me that seeks friends and avoids enemies? Where is he? Sometimes the mind is apparent; then other times it is hiding. I must find out where the mind exists. Of what substance is it composed? By analysis, I can understand what aspect of my inner self is the mind. Then, having some idea of what the mind is, I may analyse that part of me which deals with reason, the intelligence. Where is the intelligence?"},{"class":"b44","text":" When the mind demands something, the intelligence says, “Don’t take that, don’t eat that.” By introspection, I may look within and find out what is that principle in me which reasons? Where is that fine thing? What is its nature, its substance, its existence? We shall try in our introspection to find it out, substantially. If that is possible, then the next step will take us to the soul. What is that soul which makes possible the intelligence, the reason by which we act, which prompts the mind to want and also gives our senses the power to connect with things? What is that spark of knowledge? Where is that soul within me? What position does it hold? I want to see it face to face. Then in this way, we can evaporate like lightning all the misconceptions of the body and mind. By finding the soul through introspection, we may experience the lightning touch of realisation."},{"class":"b44","text":" At that time, the whole world will be turned in a diametrically different line, and we shall see things differently: “Oh, this material life is undesirable! These senses are enemies in the garb of friends. If I confront them now, they say that I may have an honourable friendship with them and that without them I can’t live. But it is all a hoax.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" From a realisation of the soul, from the point of that wonderful knowledge, one may come to see the ocean of knowledge. One may begin to see what is in the subjective area and hanker for how to come in connection with that divine realm. At that time, the very trend of one’s life will be changed, and a total change will come in our search, in our standard of prospect in life. And our search will take a concrete shape in devotion. In this way, we must begin our search after the higher sphere. And how to enter there?"},{"class":"b44","text":" It is the opposite of this plane of exploitation. In Milton’s <span class=\\"e3\\">Paradise Lost</span>, Satan said, “It is better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.” But we shall experience just the opposite: “It is better to serve in heaven than to reign in hell.” To serve in heaven is highly superior than to reign in hell."},{"class":"b44","text":" The question of energy and power is important in the mortal world, but in the constant and eternal world, this sort of energy has no value. That plane is composed of eternal substance. It is not like this troubling plane which is always breaking, always disappearing, always disappointing, and full of treachery. That divine plane is constant. Life goes on there without any need of food, rest, or medicine. There is no need of the labour to earn bread in that higher realm. All these things are not necessary in a plane of reality where everything is permanent and of eternal value. All these problems which are making us madly busy are easily eliminated in one stroke. That is the nature of that plane. And if we realise that we are members of that plane, then the question becomes what to do? How to approach the higher realm? That will be our problem. We cannot force our entry there; we must be granted a visa. We cannot master that finer realm; we must allow ourselves to be utilised by it. In other words, we must come to the position of slavery. We shall have to realise that mastership here in the mortal world is a curse and the slavery in that higher world is a boon."},{"class":"b51","text":" And the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> will help us in our progressive march towards that higher plane."},{"class":"b60","text":" naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā<br />bhagavaty uttama-śloke bhaktir bhavati naiṣṭhikī"},{"class":"b43","text":" The impure, undesirable things within us are going to almost completely vanish, almost disappear by our serving association with the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> and the devotee.

He says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā</span>: spirit is true, the world is false. Śaṅkar Āchārya says that brahma (spirit) exists, and that sarva (everything) does not exist. If this is actually true, and everything is one, then why does the question of existence or nonexistence arise at all?"},{"class":"b44","text":" In the aphorism <span class=\\"e3\\">sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">sarva</span>—everything—exists, and <span class=\\"e3\\">brahma</span>—spirit—also exists. In this expression, many exist and one also exists. There are many, and there is one."},{"class":"b44","text":" Again, if everything is one, then the question arises: to whom are we speaking? For whom have the Vedas come with this advice? Both the relative and the absolute exist together; they are coexistent. The absolute and the relative are also represented in the Vedāntic aphorism <span class=\\"e3\\">tat tvam asi</span>: thou art that. <span class=\\"e3\\">Tat</span> or ‘that’ is there, and <span class=\\"e3\\">tvam</span>, ‘you’, is also there. Both variety and unity are found represented in the aphorism <span class=\\"e3\\">tat tvam asi</span>, but Śaṅkar Āchārya accepts one and rejects the other. His explanation is therefore a misinterpretation of the original meaning of the Vedānta-sūtras. It is not a proper interpretation of the Vedas because he has thrust his own idea or conception forward in the name of the Vedānta. Śaṅkar Āchārya’s interpretation of Vedānta is artificial. It is selfish and provincial."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is the refutation of Śaṅkar Āchārya given by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, and as far as we are concerned, it cannot be seen otherwise. If we try to follow the interpretation of Śaṅkar Āchārya, then what meaning can be found in this statement of the Upaniṣads, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante, yena jātāni jīvanti:</span> the Absolute Truth is He from whom everything is coming, who is maintaining everything, within whom everything exists, and into whom everything enters at the time of annihilation.” What does this mean? Does this statement say that the Absolute is nondifferentiated? It is sufficient for our understanding to accept its direct meaning. The self-explanatory meaning of these words is sufficient to understand this simple statement of the Upaniṣads."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu defeats Śaṅkar Āchārya through common sense. This is the unique characteristic of His argument. He defeats His philosophical opponents not with difficult, abstract, intellectual arguments, but with common sense."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Śrī Chaitanya wanted to demonstrate the supremacy of Nārāyaṇ over Śiva, he said that one may just consider the position of the Ganges. The Ganges is the water that washes the feet of Nārāyaṇ, and yet she rests on the head of Śiva. From this, we can easily use common sense to see which of the two holds the superior position. When Śrī Chaitanya wanted to show that Kṛṣṇa is greater than Nārāyaṇ, He pointed to the example of Lakṣmī Devī. She aspires after the association of Kṛṣṇa. Although she has everything with Nārāyaṇ, still she has some aspiration for the company of Kṛṣṇa. On the other hand, the gopīs have no attraction for Nārāyaṇ. When they meet Nārāyaṇ, they pray that by His grace their devotion to Kṛṣṇa may be enhanced."},{"class":"b51","text":" In this way, by applying common sense, intuition, we may judge the nature of reality. Intuition will be far more helpful than abstruse argument. Vedānta confirms this in the aphorism <span class=\\"e3\\">tarkāpratiṣṭhānāt</span>: “Argument can never help us reach any real conclusion.” Rather, it is only intuition and common sense that can really help us. This is the recommendation of Śrī Chaitanya, and this is how He refuted many scholars including even the great all-conquering Digvijayī Paṇḍit of Kashmir."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question: </span>The Buddhists say that after one transcends sensory experience, he will find that underneath it all there is actually no foundation of life.

Because the Buddhists do not accept the Vedic scriptures, they are considered atheists. Śaṅkar Āchārya, in a hidden way, also preaches on behalf of the Buddhists. The difference between them is that Śaṅkar Āchārya admits the existence of brahma as the fundamental reality whereas the Buddhists say that ultimately nothing exists."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Vaiṣṇava Āchāryas disagree with both Śaṅkar Āchārya and with Buddha. They say that the jīva is an individual eternal soul. This particle of spiritual energy known as the jīva or spirit is tiny, like the dust particles of earth or the pencils-rays of the sun. There is the Supreme Infinite Soul or Consciousness, and the finite sparks of consciousness. Their relationship may be compared to the relationship between a great fire and the sparks that emanate from the fire. The sparks that emanate from the fire may become covered by darkness, but when they re-enter the shelter of that great conflagration, they are again perfectly situated."},{"class":"b44","text":" To refute the atheism of the Buddhists, we may look to the modern European philosopher Descartes. Descartes said, “I doubt everything. Whatever you say, I doubt.” Then, Descartes says, the question that arises is, “Does the doubter exist: true or false?” You have to start your search for truth from there. Who am I? To whatever truth is related, whatever idea is stated, one may say, “I oppose that statement. I doubt it.” Then the question arises does the doubter exist, or is he nonexistent? If he is nonexistent, then there can be no question of doubting. If one takes the position of an extreme sceptic, he must explain his own position. He may assert, “Whatever you have said, I doubt”, but he must discern whether or not he really exists. That must be the starting point for any further enquiry."},{"class":"b44","text":" And what is the doubter? Is he an atom? A particle of dust? Is he without knowledge? And if so, then how has he comes to assert doubt? This question should be examined. Whenever one may doubt, the question must be asked, “Who is the doubter? Is he conscious? Does he have reason? Has he any existence at all? Or is he imaginary? Is it matter that is submitting the question? Or is a unit of consciousness asking the question? What is the origin of this question? Who is asking the question? Has it come from the conscious region? If it has, then what shall we consider as the basis of existence? Consciousness or matter? A fossil or God?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Before the First World War, I was a student of law in the university. In my senior year, I studied philosophy under a professor named Mr. Stevenson. He was a German scholar, but during the war he took Indian citizenship. His class dealt with ontology and psychology. Professor Stevenson’s language was very simple, and he used fine arguments to make his point. He gave four arguments against atheism, one of which I find very useful: “Consciousness is the starting point of everything.” Whatever you say presupposes consciousness. Any statement presupposes consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" If we examine the fossil, what do we see? It is black, it is hard, it has some smell, some attributes, but what are these things? These are all different stages of consciousness. Without the help of consciousness, no assertion can be made. No assertion is possible at all. One may say that the fossil is the most elemental substance, but a fossil means what? Some colour, sensation, hardness, taste, but the background is consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" After everything is analysed, we will find that it is an idea. This is Berkeley’s theory. Everything is an idea in the ocean of consciousness. Just as an iceberg floats in the salt ocean, so the fossil is floating in the conscious ocean. Ultimately, everything—whatever we can assert, whatever is within the world of our experience—is floating like an iceberg in the ocean of consciousness. This point can never be refuted."},{"class":"b44","text":" I have had personal experience of this. When I was twenty-three, I had some deep and natural indifference to the world. At that time, I had an experience of the reality of consciousness. I felt the material world floating on consciousness just as cream floats on milk. Conscious reality is much deeper than the apparent reality of our present experience. The world of experience is like cream floating on milk which is the mind. This physical world is only the visible portion of reality floating over the mental world. I felt this myself. When there is a huge quantity of milk, the cream that floats over the milk and covers it is very meagre. In the same way, I could feel at that time that this physical world is only a meagre portion of reality, and that the subtle world, which is at present in the background, is far more vast. The mental world is a huge and vast reality, and the physical world is a small cover over that mental world."},{"class":"b44","text":" Whatever can be perceived by the eye, the ear, the tongue, the nose, the skin—any of the external senses—is only a covering of reality. In <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, Prahlād Mahārāj says, <span class=\\"e3\\">na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi Viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ</span>. We are making too much of the covering of reality, we are devoting our minds to the external coating—<span class=\\"e3\\">bahir-artha-māninaḥ</span>—but we do not dive deep into the eternal substance. If only we were to dive deep into reality, there we would find Viṣṇu. The most peaceful substance is within, but it is covered, just as milk is covered by cream, and we are making much of that cover. The real substance is within, just as fruit is covered by its skin. What we experience at present is the cover, the skin, and we are making much of that, ignoring the very substance which the cover is protecting."},{"class":"b44","text":" The primary step in the search for truth is to penetrate the covering and find the knower within. And then begin our analysis. What is he? Is he an atom like an atomic particle of dust? Or is he a fantastic atom in the conscious plane? At first we must approach reality in this way. There is the knower and the unknown, the enquirer and the enquired."},{"class":"b44","text":" Try to find yourself. Then gradually, you will come to know that you are the soul, the particle of consciousness within. And just as you are spirit covered by matter, the whole world is also like that; the spiritual reality within is covered. Upon realising your self as spirit soul, you will be able to see that everything is a part of consciousness. Within the world of consciousness, worlds of different sorts of experience are floating. In the conscious sea, the sun, the moon, trees, stones, human beings, our friends, and our enemies are all floating. As we approach the spiritual plane, we will find it to be nearer to our real self. And in this way, we will see that matter is far, far away, but the soul is near."},{"class":"b44","text":" Try to conceive of reality along these lines. Soul, spirit, consciousness, is nearer to the soul, and you are a child of that soil. Matter is far, far away. But the interrupting planes are so close together that we don’t see the nature of spiritual reality. Just as if you put your hand over your eye, you can’t see the hand. But if the hand is only one foot away, we can see it very clearly. Sometimes what is very close, we cannot see. I may be able to see so many things, but I cannot see myself."},{"class":"b51","text":" Although the Buddhists and other atheists argue that consciousness is a material thing, I say that there is no material thing. If I am to answer the question of whether or not consciousness is produced from matter, then I shall say that nothing is material. Whatever we feel is only a part of consciousness. Everything is an idea. We are concerned only with consciousness from the beginning to the end of our experience. Beyond that we cannot go. Everything is an idea: the stone, the tree, the house, the body—all are ideas. The plane of consciousness is very much closer to us than we perceive. And what is shown as a particular thing is far away. We are involved only with ideas. We can’t go outside that. Everything within our experience is a part of our mind."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question: </span>The Purāṇas say that there are 8,400,000 species of life.

Yet these ideas are real because they are also originally present in the spiritual reality Vṛndāvan. Nothing is eliminated in our conception of reality; everything is harmonious. Everything has its proper position; nothing is to be eliminated. The only thing necessary is harmony. Only our outlook, our angle of vision, needs to be changed. But in order to have that kind of vision, we must give up being self-centred. Both exploitation and renunciation must be given up. These two things cause this hallucination. Everything has its contribution to the service of the Supreme Centre, and if we can understand that, we become free from this relative world. The material world is a reflection of the spiritual world. There is undesirability here. From Brahmā, who holds the highest position in this universe, to the lowest creature (<span class=\\"e3\\">ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ</span>), everyone is prone to misconception. On the other hand, everything in Vṛndāvan contributes towards the Pastimes of Rādhā-Govinda."},{"class":"b44","text":" Everything in Vṛndāvan is Kṛṣṇa conscious: every tree, creeper, and shrub. How can they be useless or ordinary shrubs and creepers? Uddhava is the greatest devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and he aspires to take birth as a creeper or a shrub in Vṛndāvan. What then, is the value of the shrubs and creepers of Vṛndāvan! Should we think that Uddhava’s aspiration is imaginary or theoretical, with no practical value?"},{"class":"b44","text":" Everything in Vṛndāvan is necessary for the Pastimes of Rādhā-Govinda. Everything in the spiritual environment has its indirect value. This is called śānta-rasa, or passive mellow. It may be understood in this way: if a man does not harm anybody, even a fly or a mosquito, that does not mean that he is paralysed or diseased; he is simply in a passive mood. So, in Vṛndāvan, service may be rendered in a passive mood. The Yamunā River, the trees, the birds, and the insects, are absorbed in rendering service in a passive mood."},{"class":"b44","text":" How this is so can be understood by the analogy of a drama. In a drama in the theatre, an actor may play the part of a dead man. As his body is being carried, he can’t say anything; he can’t move. That does not mean that he is dead. Similarly, a devotee in śānta-rasa may assume a passive role as a creeper, a shrub, or a tree in Vṛndāvan, in order to enhance the drama of Rādhā-Govinda-līlā."},{"class":"b44","text":" A devotee may also accept the role of a servant. He may be a king, but for the satisfaction of the Lord, he may play the part of a sweeper. While one is playing the part of a sweeper, he may perform his role so nicely that the men standing by applaud in appreciation. So, the mood of servitude is also a contribution to the service of Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" Another example of śānta-rasa is Rādhā Kuṇḍa. Rādhā Kuṇḍa, the bathing place of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, where Kṛṣṇa enacts His Pastimes of conjugal love, is considered to be the highest place in Vṛndāvan. The gods and devotees all praise Rādhā Kuṇḍa. Should we think it to be an ordinary body of water? Rather, how exalted is the position of Rādhā Kuṇḍa."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then there is Govardhan Hill. That is also a kind of pose.

Foot-dust is generally inanimate. But when Chaitanya Mahāprabhu prays, “Consider me foot-dust”, the dust He speaks of is not matter; it is a unit of consciousness filled with knowledge and love. The dust of the Lord’s lotus feet is the emblem of knowledge and ecstasy. In the spiritual realm, existence and knowledge is presupposed. But more than that, the souls there are points of divine love in Vṛndāvan and Nabadwīp. And with the wholesale conversion of the souls of this world, everywhere we will find the kingdom of God. Kṛṣṇa’s kingdom, Mahāprabhu’s kingdom, exists; we have only lost the proper angle of vision by which to see it. We must once again acquire that vision. At present we are in the midst of enemies, but if our angle of vision is changed, we shall think, “No, I am in the midst of friends.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" And that angle of vision is so broad that one who sees in that way becomes fearless.

Everything is His will, and I have nothing to do with the outcome.” With this idea, wherever Jaḍa Bhārat was taken, he went without resistance. Although he was about to be sacrificed, he was unconcerned. He thought, “I am in a friendly circle. There is no danger.” He was in such a plane of consciousness that no apprehension, no danger, could affect him.

Where is He?” And in this way, the gopīs and cowherd boys run here and there searching for Kṛṣṇa.

Have you studied Hegel? Hegel’s philosophy is sometimes described as panentheism. Panentheism proposes that God is present in all things, but in contrast to pantheism it affirms that God is also an independent being above and beyond all things. Hegel is also known for Perfectionism. He says that the nature of the Absolute is both conditioned and unconditioned combined. The truth develops through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, and by this method everything progresses. According to Hegel, the Absolute is by Itself and for Itself. And he also used the German equivalent of the expression “die to live”. These were his chosen expressions."},{"class":"b51","text":" Such expressions are very useful for those in the theistic line. If you want to live a progressive life, you will have to die as you are. Your ego must be dissolved, and then the real inner or finer self will come out. This is a good philosophy to have appeared amongst the Westerners. The concept of die to live comes in the line of Vaiṣṇavism. Hegel has also said that the Absolute is “by Himself” and “for Himself”. “For Himself” means that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Enjoyer. In the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, Kṛṣṇa says:"},{"class":"b60","text":" ahaṁ hi sarva-yajñānāṁ bhoktā cha prabhur eva cha<br />na tu mām abhijānanti tattvenātaś chyavanti te"},{"class":"b43","text":" This is the most vital point to establish God as a person.

So any kind of existence presupposes a subject or consciousness. This is the crux of the argument. No object can exist without a subject. And no subject can exist without an object. There is the thinker and the thought. If there is a thinker, he must be thinking something—so an object is there. And if there is an object, then whatever attribute it has must be reflected in the consciousness of a subject. Otherwise, no existence is possible.

Similarly, the movements of the Absolute are not straight, but crooked. Vilāsa, or the conception of līlā—the divine Pastimes of the Lord—is something like that.

As a subject, I cannot make the Infinite the object of my discrimination; He is always the supersubject. I cannot make God the object of my discrimination. He is supersubjective. My position, my attitude, must invite the higher authority to come down to my level and help me, favour me. Real discrimination or knowledge should take us to self-surrender. Surrender is necessary to attract the attention of the Lord. Everything depends on His sweet will. He is an autocrat: His sweet will is everything. To attract His sweet will, to increase our negative side, our tendency for surrender, to attract His favour, this will be our real problem if we wish to progress in spiritual life. And to attract the Lord’s attention, all our qualifications must be of a negative character: we shall require surrender, submission, humility. And then we can press our position by praying, “O my Lord, I’m in the worst need; without Your grace I can’t stand. I am helpless. I cannot endure without Your favour.” That sort of hankering, earnestness, and necessity for His mercy will help us. In other words, we are to improve our negative character, and in that way we shall attract the positive, Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b51","text":" Then we shall develop proper discrimination, for at that time our subjective character will be to act only as His agent. He will inspire from within in whatever we do. Our discrimination will be utilised in carrying out His order. It will not be possible for us to have any separate interest, any original discrimination. I will carry out His order, or the order of the higher officer of the Supreme Lord. I may use my discrimination about how to make the lower arrangements in carrying out that order. But towards the Lord, who is higher than me, my attitude will always be one of submission, surrender, obedience, allegiance, unconditional slavery. The slave mentality will help us in entering that plane. If we truly feel ourselves to be low and in want, then the supply of mercy will come from the higher plane. This should always be the tenor of our thought: high and low, subjective and objective. And Kṛṣṇa is not subject to any rule; He is an autocrat. These are the data we must keep in our mind always. Everything moves according to His sweet will. Our problem, then, is how to draw His attention. This will be possible only by increasing our negative tendency, by proving to Him, in a bona fide way, that I’m the most needy. At that time, we shall develop proper discrimination and knowledge; that is, our discrimination will be utilised in carrying out His order."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question: </span>In the <span class=\\"e3\\">Īśopaniṣad</span>, there is a mantra:"},{"class":"b60","text":" vidyāṁ chāvidyāṁ cha yas tad vedobhayaṁ saha<br />avidyayā mṛtyuṁ tīrtvā vidyayāmṛtam aśnute"},{"class":"b50","text":" The translation has been given by Śrīpād Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj as follows: “Only one who can learn the process of nescience and that of transcendental knowledge side by side can transcend the influence of repeated birth and death and enjoy the full blessings of immortality.” What does he mean by learning the process of nescience and that of knowledge side by side?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj:</span> One is negative and another is positive.

To know the bad, to culture the bad, means to know when a thing is bad and to reject it, and to culture the truth means to accept it.

Noble ignorance in our view is jñāna-śūnyā-bhakti, knowledge-free devotion. Noble ignorance means not to attempt to calculate in this world but to surrender: to lose our faith in calculation, in our subjective capacity of calculation, and to surrender to the Supreme. We may interpret jñāna-śūnyā-bhakti like that. “Learned ignorance” is when learning understands its own limit, when one realises, “I’m finite, my learning is also finite; learning cannot make me a bona fide enquirer about the Infinite.” It is better to surrender to the Infinite and let Him work within us for our best interest. Submission, surrender to the Infinite, is the highest reach of learning. Learned ignorance means to realise that we can’t know the Infinite.

It may be explained that the necessity of Guru is there; it is universal. To err is human, but not to err is also an inner tendency. Śrī Gurudev comes to give us relief from our internal trouble. In this way the conception of Guru may be developed. The necessity for Guru can be inferred from the universal basis of nature which is present around us."},{"class":"b44","text":" And from there it will gradually move to the Absolute. Ultimately, the conception of Guru will come to Kṛṣṇa. In this highest sense, Kṛṣṇa is Guru. Who can remove all our doubts and satisfy all our enquiries? It is Kṛṣṇa alone. Gradually, our faith will develop and take us to the one who can clear all our doubts. We may have doubts upon doubts. One doubt may go and thousands of doubts may come, but Guru is one who can clear all our doubts—<span class=\\"e3\\">bhidyate hṛdaya-granthiś chhidyante sarva-saṁśayāḥ</span> (<span class=\\"e3\\">SB:</span> 1.2.21)—who can do away with all the suspicions in our mind; it is he who is full. In this way we must progress. The birth of our faith may be in intellectualism, but its goal is transcendental. The birth of our search and its destination will come to meet together. The birth of faith is from the potency of Kṛṣṇa, and after moving through the whole of the Infinite, it will come again to the potency where we will take our eternal position."},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa consciousness means the Infinite in the finite: the affectionate connection of the finite with the Infinite helps him to live in infinity. The finite backed by the Infinite may become infinitely resourceful. Our Guru Mahārāj gave the example that if a poor girl marries a prince, although she may have nothing, by her affectionate relationship with the prince, she turns into a princess. So, one who has nothing, only a friendly relationship, gets command over everything. This is the nature of Kṛṣṇa consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" One’s resources may increase in that way. Intrinsically, a jīva-soul is insignificant. It is an infinitesimal point of a point of a point, but by coming in affectionate connection with the Absolute, he gets the facility of all the advantages of a life with the Absolute. Then, he or she is in possession of the Whole. We cannot really ascertain anyone’s potency or power without considering his relationship with others. Israel is a small country. Russia could conquer it in five minutes, but—America is there. So, relationships, connections, and friends must be taken into consideration when understanding the power of a thing."},{"class":"b52","text":" There is a fable that shows how a small bird was able to disturb and even control the whole ocean. Once, a small bird laid her eggs by the ocean’s shore, but the ocean carried the eggs away. When the ocean stole her eggs, the bird became angry and asked for them back, but the ocean would not return them. The bird went to her master, that bird went to his master, and in this way they finally went to Garuḍa, the master of all birds. Garuḍa is the servant bird carrier of Viṣṇu. And Garuḍa came to the aid of that small bird. He threatened the ocean, “If you don’t return this little bird’s eggs immediately, I shall drink you to the last drop.” The ocean had to submit. In this way the unlimited ocean was conquered by a small bird. As the moral of this story, Paṇḍit Viṣṇu Śarma gives this conclusion: “When examining a person, we must consider his friends and the friends of his friends. Without such considerations, we should not try to estimate the power of a particular thing.” Because of friendly association, the ocean was conquered. In the same way, by making friendship with the Infinite, one can conquer the Infinite."}]},{"title":"Pure Devotion","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b47","text":" Pure Devotion"},{"class":"b50","text":" Once, Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur had a dream in which he was wandering in the sky chanting the Holy Name.

And whatever he is doing is cent per cent right.” But then the next passage says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā</span>: very soon he will be a man of righteousness; he will become dharmātmā—dutiful.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" As Yamarāj, Brahmā, and Nārad discussed this point, a question came up. Kṛṣṇa says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Bhajate Mām ananya-bhāk</span>: one who is My exclusive devotee.” The question arises, “What is exclusive devotion or ananya-bhajan?” Kṛṣṇa says, “Give up all other religious conceptions and surrender to Me alone: <span class=\\"e3\\">sarva-dharmān parityajya Mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span>.” That is exclusive devotion. But if one is practising exclusive devotion, then he is already dharmātmā; he is already righteous. How is it then that in the very next verse, Kṛṣṇa says, “Soon he becomes dharmātmā”? How are we to adjust this? Kṛṣṇa says:"},{"class":"b60","text":" kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā śaśvach-chhāntiṁ nigachchhati<br />kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati"},{"class":"b43","text":" “He soon becomes righteous (dharmātmā) and attains lasting peace.

Go and declare this to the public.” Kṛṣṇa says that after the devotee became ananya-bhāk—that is, he gave up all sorts of duties and surrendered to Kṛṣṇa—then again he will be a dutiful man."},{"class":"b44","text":" As Brahmā, Nārad, and Yamarāj discussed this point, they saw Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur walking in the sky and taking the Holy Name.

How can we understand this?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur explained that “he quickly becomes righteous” refers not to the exclusive devotee, but to one who considers the exclusive devotee pure in all circumstances. “Even if he performs some abominable acts, he is really a sādhu, a saint.” One who can think of an exclusive devotee in that way will soon become dharmātmā. This was Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur’s explanation."},{"class":"b44","text":" In this way, in my commentary on <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, I have followed Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur’s explanation. I also saw that it was redundant to say that an ananya-bhāk devotee becomes dharmātmā. Kṛṣṇa says that an exclusive devotee should be thought of as a sādhu, an honest man. One who says that an exclusive devotee, a surrendered soul to Kṛṣṇa, should be thought of as pure whatever be his external practices—the man who is making this remark—he becomes righteous. This is the proper conclusion. What he says is cent per cent truth. And the next thing Kṛṣṇa says is that he who can remark in such a way will be purified very soon."},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa says that by such appreciation of the exclusive devotee, a person will soon come to his eternal duty and attain eternal peace. “So I ask you, O son of Kuntī, Arjuna, to go and promise in public that My exclusive devotee will never be lost (<span class=\\"e3\\">Kaunteya pratijānīhi na Me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati</span>).” Then you will get the benefit of the man whose remark improves his life."},{"class":"b44","text":" Otherwise, why should Kṛṣṇa tell Arjuna, “Make a public announcement that My devotee is never ruined.” What effect will there be for Arjuna? But one who declares: “An exclusive devotee of Kṛṣṇa is saintly no matter what he does”, soon becomes righteous. If Arjuna declares this, he will become dharmātmā. He will get the benefit. So, Kṛṣṇa tells him, “You make this remark. Take a bold step; take a risk and make this remark. Then you will also get that benefit I have described.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Of course, Arjuna is a pārṣad, an eternal associate of Kṛṣṇa, but using him as an example, Kṛṣṇa tells him, “You do it.” Arjuna has taken the position of an enquirer independent of his pārṣad character."},{"class":"b44","text":" When I was publishing my commentary on <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, a godbrother once told me, “If you give such an explanation, then in the name of ananya-bhāk-bhakti, exclusive devotion, less advanced devotees will take advantage of this. What you are revealing here is a very hidden meaning. It is not meant for the public. It is a confidential point. <span class=\\"e3\\">Api chet sudurāchāro bhajate Mām ananya-bhāk, sādhur eva</span>: ‘He may be the worst debauchee in his outer life. But if he is ananya-bhāk, a surrendered soul, he should be considered a really honest man.’ If you explain things according to your interpretation, everyone will say, ‘Oh, I am an ananya-bhāk devotee’, and they will go on with their debauchery. So please, don’t express this interpretation of yours so explicitly.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" But I published my commentary over this objection because the principle underlying this verse is an important one. One who has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa is accepted as His own. And just as Kṛṣṇa has rights over everything and is never a trespasser, so His own man should never be considered a trespasser at any time. This is confirmed elsewhere in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Ātmā bhūyāya cha kalpate:</span> My devotee belongs to Me.” So, one who works by inspiration from Kṛṣṇa should never be considered a trespasser. He can enjoy anything on Kṛṣṇa’s behalf if he is really a surrendered soul. He should be considered as Kṛṣṇa’s. He has free access to everything that belongs to Kṛṣṇa. But some objected, saying, “Don’t be so broad in your interpretation. If you do so, then the people at large will do abominable things in the name of pure devotion. They will say, ‘Oh, I am Vaiṣṇava. I am achyuta-gotra, I am one of Kṛṣṇa’s own men. What is His property is mine. I can enjoy everything.’”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then of course the question comes, “How do we recognise ananya-bhāk-bhakti, exclusive devotion?” The real trouble is here. Merely professing that I am a pure devotee won’t do. Rather, a real devotee will think, “I am not a real devotee.” That will be his understanding, his inner feeling. Exclusive devotion is not a small thing. A genuine devotee thinks, “I can’t be an ananya-bhāk-bhakta. I have not attained that stage. It is very difficult. Rather, I am going away from that.” That will be the general tenor of his attitude."},{"class":"b44","text":" What to speak of lesser devotees, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī Herself says, “People associate me with Kṛṣṇa. They say that I have an illicit connection with Kṛṣṇa. But what they say is all false. My grief is that I could not give My entire heart to Kṛṣṇa. I cannot say that I am completely His. My internal trouble is that I could not become wholly His, and they falsely think that I am. I have no objection to becoming fully His, even to having an illicit connection with Him, but that I can’t become so. This is My great fault.” That will be the general attitude of a real ananya-bhāk-bhakta."},{"class":"b44","text":" Just the opposite tendency will come. The fact is that one who has accepted Kṛṣṇa exclusively has no taste for any other thing, so really he is not durāchāra; he is not capable of acting in an abominable way. Internally, he is always connected with Kṛṣṇa. In external life, he is indifferent. So, what he is doing is not done by him. One who acts in that plane of reality may destroy thousands of universes but does not do anything (<span class=\\"e3\\">hatvāpi sa imā̐n lokān na hanti na nibadhyate</span>). He is acting in the transcendental plane, the nirguṇa plane. He is not to be seen in terms of what is good or bad in the calculation of this world. He is absent here."},{"class":"b44","text":" What is in connection with Kṛṣṇa is all good; it is nirguṇa, transcendental, without material qualities. In this world, truth is a relative thing. “This is true, this is not true, this is mine, this is yours”—what value do these things have? If a devotee steals a flower for Kṛṣṇa, you may say, “Oh, why are you stealing my flower?” But what is the guarantee that the flower belongs to you? These are different stages of bogus conceptions of reality. A man who has possession of some land declares himself the owner. Then a big landowner comes and says, “You are not the owner. I have real possession of this land. I have allowed you only to use it.” But beyond the landowner a king may come and say, “Oh no, this is my land. Your ownership is only relative. I am the ruler of this land. It belongs to me.” In this way, one relative conception of truth fights with another. And morality stands only on this conception: “This is mine, this is yours.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" All these conceptions of ownership are false. All these transactions of morality are false, because they are not in connection with the Supreme Truth. So, the devotee’s apparent misbehaviour is quite the contrary in reality."},{"class":"b59","text":" ‘dvaite’ bhadrābhadra-jñāna, saba—‘manodharma’<br />‘ei bhāla, ei manda’,—ei saba ‘bhrama’"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Chaitanya-charitāmṛta: Antya-līlā, 4.176)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “In the material world, conceptions of good and bad or right and wrong are all mental concoctions. Therefore, saying, ‘This is good and this is bad’ is all a mistake.” So, in the deepest plane of reality, the deepest wave of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is moving, and there so many jīva-souls are dancing. And that dance is the absolute dance wherein everything surrenders to Kṛṣṇa in the mood of Vṛndāvan: <span class=\\"e3\\">sarva-dharmān parityajya Mām ekaṁ</span>. Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, and for His satisfaction anything and everything can be done. This is the only principle followed by the exclusive devotees without caring for the many relative demands and strictures of this false plane. That is nirguṇa, transcendental. In that plane, the calculation of false ownership can’t be applied. All claims of ownership have no value in Kṛṣṇa consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" There is another point that may also be considered in this verse. Once, Parāśar Muni was crossing a river. A young lady was piloting the boat. As the boat reached the middle of the river, Parāśar suddenly became charmed by that young lady. He proposed that they unite, and they did. As a result of their union, Vedavyās was born. Parāśar was already a man of higher sense control. But the time had come for the birth of Vyās, and this created a necessity at a particular stage in him. Suddenly, he was overwhelmed by lust and united with that lady. From their union came Vyāsadev, the compiler of all the Vedic scriptures. So, this was the determination of the universal will. Parāśar is not to be accused or condemned. He is not a party to that. He is an instrument of the universal will. We should not consider this an event of lustfulness and criticise Parāśar for his immoral action. He was inspired by some inner will and overpowered by the divine force of the nirguṇa will of Kṛṣṇa. Only then did these things take place."},{"class":"b44","text":" Therefore, Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that it is not the action, but the background of the action that is to be considered. That is to be examined, not the action alone. The motive underlying the action, not the karma, but the purpose—that is the culprit. Draupadī had five husbands, but not of her own accord. She had to accept the trouble as her duty; she did not do so for the sake of pleasure. So, Draupadī should not be held responsible for this; it cannot be said that she is unchaste. She cannot be held responsible for having many husbands. It is said in the śāstra that Draupadī or Kuntī may seem to be unchaste, but if you chant their names, you will be purified. So, the internal meaning of an act, its purpose, should be considered—not the external action."},{"class":"b51","text":" The higher principle is served not by following ordinary law, but by following some higher law. In that case, the ordinary law is surpassed. One might think a devotee a culprit from the consideration of ordinary law, but from the consideration of a higher law, Kṛṣṇa has said that if you can appreciate their law-breaking, you will be uplifted."},{"class":"b59","text":" ājñāyaivaṁ guṇān doṣān mayādiṣṭān api svakān<br />dharmān santyajya yaḥ sarvān māṁ bhajeta sa tu sattamaḥ"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad Bhāgavatam: 11.11.32)"},{"class":"b43","text":" Kṛṣṇa says, “The rules of the scriptures come from My direction, My order. But if anyone breaks those rules to satisfy Me, he should be considered a better devotee.” Sometimes it may be necessary to show even greater loyalty to the king by crossing over the laws of the king. So here, God is above law. When we consider the nature of divinity, we must conclude that Kṛṣṇa is above law. Law is for us. But law may not be applied in His case. He is absolute. When one has actually come in connection with the Absolute, he cannot but ignore the laws meant for ordinary people. Of course, this means in a higher sense. It is not that devotees shall not observe the ordinary laws governing society in the name of devotion. But in the higher sense we have to understand that Kṛṣṇa is all-in-all. He is the creator of law, and He Himself sometimes breaks the law and especially likes those who are ready to break the law for Him. They are His favourite who are ready to take risks for His service, who are ready to bear the consequence of breaking the law."},{"class":"b51","text":" This is the nature of Kṛṣṇa’s entire Vraja-līlā. In Vṛndāvan, all considerations of individual and local interest are sacrificed. In Vṛndāvan, there is the highest self-sacrifice, to the degree that everyone’s own particular interest or consideration is sacrificed into fire.

Just as <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> has four essential verses, there are four essential verses in <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> which contain the very gist, the very substance of the whole ontological conception of <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>."},{"class":"b51","text":" In <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (10.8), the first of the four nutshell verses is as follows:"},{"class":"b60","text":" ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate<br />iti matvā bhajante māṁ budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ"},{"class":"b43","text":" “I am the origin of everything.

Brahma means the all-comprehensive aspect of the Absolute. Paramātmā means the all-permeating aspect of the Absolute, and Bhagavān means the personal conception of the Absolute."},{"class":"b44","text":" In his <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhakti-sandarbha</span>, Jīva Goswāmī has given the real meaning of Bhagavān, the Personality of Godhead. The general meaning of Bhagavān is “one who commands all sorts of potencies.” All sorts of potencies are controlled by Him personally. That is the conception of Bhagavān found in Nārāyaṇ of Vaikuṇṭha. But Jīva Goswāmī has given a particularly fine interpretation of Bhagavān. He says that Bhagavān means <span class=\\"e3\\">bhajanīya-sarva-sad-guṇa-viśiṣṭa</span>: the nature of Bhagavān is such that whatever comes in contact with Him feels a natural serving tendency towards His charming personality. He is endowed with such qualities that everyone is drawn to worship Him, to love Him. He attracts the love of everyone. Everyone wants to serve Him—this is Bhagavān. He is endowed with qualities that attract everyone to serve Him."},{"class":"b44","text":" I have included this special interpretation of Jīva Goswāmī in my commentary on the above <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> verse. In the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, three phases of the Absolute Truth have been described (all-comprehensive Brahma, all-pervading Paramātmā, and the all-attractive, absolute person, Bhagavān). I have explained in my commentary that Kṛṣṇa’s statement here (<span class=\\"e3\\">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo</span>) means: “I am Svayam Bhagavān, the Original Personality of Godhead. I am at the root of all these three conceptions of the Absolute. And I am the origin not only of Brahma, the all-comprehensive Absolute, and Paramātmā, the all-permeating Absolute, but also of Nārāyaṇ, the master of all potencies who commands the respect of everyone.

And in the next line, when Kṛṣṇa says <span class=\\"e3\\">Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span>, here we must concentrate more finely. Kṛṣṇa says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Sarvaṁ pravartate</span>: everything comes from Me.” With this, Kṛṣṇa is saying, “Even worship of Me comes from Me. I reveal it first. I Myself worship Myself. I do this as Guru, as My finer potency. This potency is nothing but Myself. And My finest potency is Rādhārāṇī. Through My potency, I worship Myself. Every movement begins from Me; even My own worship. My own service is begun by Me, in My role as Guru. I reveal that to the public so that you will properly worship Me. For this reason, Guru is called Bhagavān, for he is nondifferent from Me (<span class=\\"e3\\">Āchāryaṁ Māṁ vijānīyān</span>).”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The finest potency of Bhagavān is Rādhārāṇī. So, Guru in the highest sense, as well as service in the highest sense, is represented in Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Next, Kṛṣṇa says, “Those who know this will worship Me (<span class=\\"e3\\">iti matvā bhajante Māṁ</span>).” Those who understand this conception, that Rādhārāṇī serves Him in the highest way, will serve Kṛṣṇa in subjugation to Her. That is Rādhā-dāsyam, the divine service of Śrī Rādhā. And it is with this understanding that a worshiper will come to worship Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" In my interpretation, I have taken it that this is Kṛṣṇa’s intent when He says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Iti matvā bhajante Māṁ</span>: knowing this, they worship Me.” He means, “Those who know that My worship comes from Me, and that My finest potency worships Me best, will worship Me under the direction of My finest potency.” Here we find the importance of Rādhā-dāsyam, the service of Śrī Rādhā, the highest goal of the followers of Rūpa Goswāmī, the Rūpānuga–Gauḍīya sampradāya. Here, Kṛṣṇa is saying, “Knowing that it is My finest potency that worships Me best, one will worship Me under the direction of My first-class worshiper (Śrī Rādhā). With this idea, one will always worship Me under the guidance of My finest śakti, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, or Her representation, Śrī Gurudev.

Their whole life, their entire energy, is spent for Me, utilised for Me. Their prāṇā-śakti, their life-energy, is also fully devoted for My cause. Internally, they are always thinking about Me and devoting their whole energy for Me, and externally they talk about Me to enhance their mutual understanding (<span class=\\"e3\\">bodhayantaḥ parasparam</span>). They love to talk about Me with one another; they talk about nothing else. In private life, and in public life also, they love to talk about Me, and nothing else. I am the only subject of their discussions (<span class=\\"e3\\">kathayantaś cha Māṁ nityaṁ</span>). Whatever they do, wherever they are—everywhere—I am the subject of their talk.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" And next Kṛṣṇa says, “In this they find great satisfaction (<span class=\\"e3\\">tuṣyanti cha ramanti cha</span>).” The internal meaning of <span class=\\"e3\\">tuṣyanti cha ramanti cha</span> is as follows. Here two levels of devotees are described. Up to vātsalya-rasa, or the parental mellow of devotion, Kṛṣṇa’s devotees are feeling great satisfaction (<span class=\\"e3\\">tuṣyanti</span>). And above this is the higher kind of satisfaction (<span class=\\"e3\\">ramanti</span>) experienced in the madhura-rasa. Just as a wife and husband enjoy a particular kind of connection, Kṛṣṇa’s devotees feel ecstasy (<span class=\\"e3\\">ramanti</span>) in His connection, simply by talking about Him. Here the Āchāryas have agreed that the word <span class=\\"e3\\">ramanti</span> indicates consorthood, and that devotees in consorthood can experience the very deep connection of husband and wife in relation to Kṛṣṇa. In the company of Kṛṣṇa, they feel the ecstasy of consorthood, <span class=\\"e3\\">ramanti cha</span>. They also feel that ecstasy even when they are only talking about Kṛṣṇa. This meaning of the word <span class=\\"e3\\">ramanti</span> has been explained in different places by Viśvanāth, Baladev, Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, and is also admitted even by Śaṅkar Āchārya, who agrees that the word <span class=\\"e3\\">ramanti</span> indicates consorthood."},{"class":"b51","text":" Then there is the next nutshell verse of <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (10.10):"},{"class":"b60","text":" teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam<br />dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te"},{"class":"b43","text":" “To those who constantly worship Me with devotion, I give the intelligence by which they can come to Me.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" This is the ordinary meaning of this verse, but there is a deeper meaning. Here, Kṛṣṇa says, “Those persons who are continuously engaged in Me without interruption (<span class=\\"e3\\">satata-yuktānāṁ</span>), who are always in Me, who are connected with Me, who serve Me with great love and respect with their heart—<span class=\\"e3\\">dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ</span>—I inspire them with the intelligence by which they will come to Me. They will come to Me in a closer connection.” But I found that this is redundant. Kṛṣṇa has already said <span class=\\"e3\\">satata-yuktānāṁ</span>: “Their devotion is continuous; they are always there in My connection.” If they are already in connection with Kṛṣṇa, then we must ask why He would again say, “They will come to Me.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa has already said that these devotees talk only of Him, think only of Him, take pleasure in Him, and are always engaged in His service. He says, “They are always connected with Me without interruption, and they are serving Me with heartfelt love.” They are already serving with heartfelt love, and then Kṛṣṇa says, “I shall give them the inspiration by which they will come to Me (<span class=\\"e3\\">Mām upayānti te</span>).” This is redundant. It has already been said that they are connected to Kṛṣṇa; how is it that again they will “come to Him”? How is Kṛṣṇa’s statement “they come to Me” to be harmonised? So, I found a deeper meaning to the words <span class=\\"e3\\">Mām upayānti te</span>. I took here the word <span class=\\"e3\\">upayānti</span>, which ordinarily means “they come”, to indicate <span class=\\"e3\\">upapati</span>, or “paramour”. So, <span class=\\"e3\\">upayānti</span>, “they come to Me”, means they consider Kṛṣṇa as <span class=\\"e3\\">upapati</span>, as a paramour."},{"class":"b44","text":" In society, there is the lawful husband, or pati, and there is the paramour, or upapati. In Vṛndāvan, Kṛṣṇa is not considered by the gopīs as their lawfully married husband, but as master, as the Lord, of their hearts."},{"class":"b44","text":" Here Kṛṣṇa says, “I inspire those who are constantly engaged in devotional service to come to Me.” Which devotees does Kṛṣṇa here inspire? Those who are <span class=\\"e3\\">ramanti</span>, the highest group of devotees, those who are related to him in consorthood, in full rasa—mukhya-rasa. Kṛṣṇa says here, “I inspire them to come to Me, considering Me as paramour, upapati.” Here Kṛṣṇa says <span class=\\"e3\\">bhajatāṁ prīti pūrvakam</span>: this means <span class=\\"e3\\">prema</span>, which is generally found in madhura-rasa, consorthood. So, the real meaning of this verse is that Kṛṣṇa inspires those who are in consorthood to come to Him, seeing Him as paramour, upapati. And how do they come to Him? He inspires them to come to Him without any consideration of social and scriptural demands. And so, inspired by Him from within, crossing the line of scriptural and social regulations, and even deceiving their own husbands, the gopīs are united with Kṛṣṇa in paramour consorthood (parakīya)."},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa’s position is absolute, and He relishes more the devotion of those who can cross everything for Him. And He inspires His devotees from within with this message: “Externally you have to fulfil social and scriptural demands, but My position is over and above the scriptures. My position is above whatever the social laws and scriptural laws tell you to do. I am above the Vedas and everything else. The Vedas are My instructions for the ordinary people. Their instructions are meant for those who are deviated from Me. Society is also under the guidance of those instructions which were given to the fallen. But My connection with everything is intrinsic; it is independent of the laws of scripture and society. I do not require recognition from anyone. My connection with everything is the constant in all equations. It can never be avoided. So, you must neglect all the demands from your previous life’s connections and come to Me. You have no freedom to do anything else. When your devotional nature will come to demand you to come to Me, you are not free. Your heart must come towards Me.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" That is upapati, paramour devotion. The devotion of Vṛndāvan. Vṛndāvan-bhajan means paramour devotion: <span class=\\"e3\\">yena Mām upayānti te</span>. So here, Kṛṣṇa says that to those who are <span class=\\"e3\\">ramanti</span>, who are already inclined to come in connection with Him in consorthood as husband and wife, He gives some special feeling and inspiration within their hearts, and they shall come to Him as upapati, as paramours. Here Kṛṣṇa is saying, in effect, “This paramour devotion is so great that it crosses the rules of both society and scripture. It is independent of everything. Connection with Me is independent of everything that you can conceive. It is most innate and natural. It does not require any scriptural or any social sanction. You may live in society showing formal respect to scriptural and social convention, but from your inner heart of hearts you are Mine. That is <span class=\\"e3\\">yena Mām upayānti te</span>, the special instruction or nature or insight I give to these devotees.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" In other words, these devotees do not allow a second pati or husband to come between them and Kṛṣṇa. They cannot tolerate the interpolation of any second thing, even if it involves social laws or scriptural regulations. Their devotion is so high that all the Vedas are searching after this idea, this divine position:"},{"class":"b59","text":" āsām aho charaṇa-reṇu-juṣām ahaṁ syāṁ<br />vṛndāvane kim api gulma-latauṣadhīnām<br />yā dustyajaṁ sva-janam ārya-pathañ cha hitvā<br />bhejur mukunda-padavīṁ śrutibhir vimṛgyām"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad Bhāgavatam: 10.47.61)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “Although the most exalted devotion of the gopīs is only hinted at in the Vedas, I can now understand their most exalted position.

Those great souls gave up society, friendship, love, their relatives—and even the Vedic principles—to take shelter of the holy lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Here, one thing should be mentioned: <span class=\\"e3\\">parakīya-bhāva</span> has a broader application. It does not only mean paramour devotion. This feeling of crossing scriptural and social rules for an ‘unsanctioned’ relationship is found not only in madhura-rasa or consorthood. <span class=\\"e3\\">Parakīya</span> literally means “belonging to another”. Vātsalya-rasa, parental affection, and sakhya-rasa, friendship, are also infused with the sentiments of parakīya. This is the method of love for those who follow rāga-mārg."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the case of Yaśodā, parakīya takes the following form: Yaśodā says, “Some people say that Kṛṣṇa is not my son. They say that he is Devakī’s son!” This feeling enhances her heart’s affection towards Kṛṣṇa, for then she thinks, “I could lose Him at any moment.” This idea draws more intense affection towards Kṛṣṇa. It increases the affection of her service."},{"class":"b44","text":" In sakhya-rasa, the sentiments of parakīya are also found. “Some say Kṛṣṇa has come from Mathurā and He may again go to Mathurā. He does not belong to us; he is not exclusively our friend.” This apprehension also fills the minds of the cowherd boys, and they become anxious, thinking, “We may lose Him at any time.” So, that sentiment makes friendly service towards Him more intense. In this way, the whole sentiment in Vṛndāvan is parakīya."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the mood of servanthood, or dāsya-rasa, also there is some sentiment like that. Devotees feel, “Some say that Kṛṣṇa comes from Mathurā, that He is the son of Vasudev. He is here only for a while; He is not an ordinary man like us.” This idea is more or less current in Vṛndāvan. So, parakīya is not only found in madhura-rasa; Kṛṣṇa may capture all with that sentiment."},{"class":"b44","text":" Parakīya is a very special thing in madhura-rasa. Its speciality is that in madhura-rasa it is more objectionable both to the scriptures and to society. But for the gopīs it is not objectionable. In madhura-rasa, they have to cross over the directions of both the Vedas and society—they must take that great risk. In other rasas, there is only the fear that “We may not have Kṛṣṇa permanently, He may go away, He does not belong among us …” This suspicion increases the intensity of their service, but in madhura-rasa, they must cross the positive directions of the Veda and society. They must go against these authorities, as if to take the risk of committing sin. This is the special feature of parakīya in madhura-rasa, so there the intensity of devotion is in its highest condition. So, the inspiration towards parakīya (<span class=\\"e3\\">yena Mām upayānti te</span>) that Kṛṣṇa discusses here with special reference to those who are <span class=\\"e3\\">ramanti</span>, who are connected to Him in consorthood, is also present in all the servitors in Vṛndāvan."},{"class":"b51","text":" Finally, we come to the last of the four nutshell verses of <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (10.11):"},{"class":"b60","text":" teṣām evānukampārtham aham ajñānajaṁ tamaḥ<br />naśayāmy ātma-bhāva-stho jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā"},{"class":"b43","text":" Kṛṣṇa says: “To show them special mercy, I enter their hearts and destroy their ignorance with the lamp of knowledge.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" The inner meaning of this verse is more difficult to draw out. The words <span class=\\"e3\\">teṣām evānukampārtham</span> may be interpreted in two ways. The external interpretation is that Kṛṣṇa favours His devotees, and the internal explanation is that Kṛṣṇa is saying, “I want their favour. I aspire after the favour of the devotees of the highest order.” As in <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> (10.82.44), Kṛṣṇa says:"},{"class":"b60","text":" mayi bhaktir hi bhūtānām amṛtatvāya kalpate<br />diṣṭyā yad āsīn mat-sneho bhavatīnāṁ mad-āpanaḥ"},{"class":"b43","text":" “My dear gopīs, everyone considers themselves fortunate if they possess devotion for Me, and by that they achieve an eternal life of nectar. But I must admit that I consider Myself most fortunate because I have come in touch with the wonderful affection found in your hearts.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Still the paradox is that Kṛṣṇa seems to say that after such grief and continued engagement with Kṛṣṇa, then He gives these higher devotees pure knowledge, and by that knowledge they get salvation by attaining Brahma. That is the point of argument made by the followers of Śaṅkar Āchārya. But I have taken it in another direction."},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Jñāna-dīpena</span> is a troublesome expression—“I enlighten them with knowledge”—so I have given another interpretation: when the pangs of separation felt by Kṛṣṇa’s devotees comes to its extreme stage, Kṛṣṇa suddenly comes and shows Himself. For example, Śachī Devī feels extreme separation when she cooks for Nimāi, and then by His mercy she can see clearly that Nimāi has come and taken prasādam. Similarly in Vṛndāvan, when the pangs of separation reach their highest degree, then suddenly the devotees can see that “Kṛṣṇa is here in our company.” So, when Kṛṣṇa says that out of His mercy He appears and removes their ignorance, their <span class=\\"e3\\">ajñāna</span>, He means that when the devotees are experiencing separation from Him, He appears before them and removes the darkness they feel from separation. Out of His mercy, He gives them sustenance. And when that sort of medicine has been applied, they can go on further. In Vṛndāvan, when His devotees felt separation, sometimes He had to come and to show His friends, “I am amongst you. I have not left you.” This is what is meant by dispelling darkness with the light of divine knowledge: <span class=\\"e3\\">jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā</span>. Here the word ignorance or <span class=\\"e3\\">ajñāna</span> means jñāna-śūnyā-bhakti, knowledge-free devotion. Devotees do not think that they are part and parcel of the līlā, the Pastimes of the Supreme God. No, their devotion is free from such calculation. It is jñāna-śūnyā-bhakti: most innocent."},{"class":"b44","text":" Here Kṛṣṇa is saying, “I can’t tolerate the pangs of separation felt by My devotees. I must run towards them and show them, ‘I am here, My mother. You see? I am here taking food.’” Sometimes Śachī Devī prepares food for the Deity, and after offering it, she sees that it is all gone. At that time, she thinks, “Was this a dream? I saw Nimāi. He was taking prasād, and of course nothing was left in the pot. But Nimāi has gone long ago. But then who has taken this prasād? What was it I saw? Was it a dream, or has some dog taken the food? Or is it that I forgot? Have I not cooked today? Perhaps I did not give the bhoga to the Bāla Gopāl Deity. What did I do?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In this way, Śachī is confused. This may be seen as her ajñāna, her ‘ignorance’. Then, Śrī Chaitanya sends some devotee to her, saying, “You tell all this to my mother: on those days when such things occur I actually go there; I take food from her hand. It is not a dream. Remind My mother of this and console her. Tell her that I come to her and I take her cooked prasādam. Remind her that this has occurred.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" So, this is the meaning of the fourth nutshell verse from <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span>: by His mercy Kṛṣṇa removes the darkness of separation from His devotees. And those that remind us of Kṛṣṇa, and thus remove the darkness born of separation from Him, are the real humanitarians. They are distributing the highest cure. The gopīs tell Kṛṣṇa, “We are suffering from this pang that is created by You. But the messages about Your Pastimes give us life and sustenance. We are eager to hear this, and then we may feel that we are getting our life back. There is no other medicine but Your assurance and consolation: that alone can save us from these pangs of the burning heart.” This is their statement in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> (10.31.9):"},{"class":"b60","text":" tava kathāmṛtaṁ tapta-jīvanaṁ<br />kavibhir īḍitaṁ kalmaṣāpaham<br />śravaṇa-maṅgalaṁ śrīmad-ātataṁ<br />bhuvi gṛṇanti ye bhūridā janāḥ"},{"class":"b55","text":" “O Kṛṣṇa, we are always suffering in this world, but just hearing the nectar of Your words and Pastimes gives us life and as a by-product it removes all of our sinful reactions.

The word <span class=\\"e3\\">gāyatrī</span> is a combination of two Sanskrit words: <span class=\\"e3\\">gānat</span> (what is sung) and <span class=\\"e3\\">trāyate</span> (gives deliverance). This means, “A kind of song by which we can get our salvation, relief, emancipation.” Gāyatrī is known as Veda-mātā, the mother of the Vedas. And Gāyatrī has produced the whole Veda. If we examine the Vedic conclusion from its most condensed aphorism to its most extensive expression, we shall find that it begins with <span class=\\"e3\\">Oṁkār</span>: the Vedic syllable <span class=\\"e3\\">Om</span>. That truth is expressed as the gāyatrī-mantra, then it appears in the form of the Vedas, and then as the <span class=\\"e3\\">Vedānta-sūtra</span>. Finally, the Vedic conclusion is given its fullest expression in the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>. Since the meaning, the purpose of Vedic knowledge progresses in this line, the gāyatrī-mantra must contain within it the meaning of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>—that is, that the Kṛṣṇa conception of Godhead is the highest."},{"class":"b44","text":" This must be the meaning of the gāyatrī-mantra, but the problem is how to extract <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>—the Kṛṣṇa conception—from within the womb of gāyatrī. I heard that Jīva Goswāmī has given such an interpretation, but I could not find where it is written. I heard that he has given the meaning of gāyatrī leading to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Anyhow, the tendency awakened in me to draw the meaning to the Kṛṣṇa conception."},{"class":"b44","text":" The general meaning of gāyatrī is “that song which grants liberation”. Liberation must have some positive meaning. Liberation means not freedom from the negative side, but positive attainment. This is the definition given in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>: <span class=\\"e3\\">muktir hitvānyathā rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</span>—unless and until we attain the highest possible positive position, real mukti, real salvation, has not been effected. Mere withdrawal from the negative plane cannot be called liberation. Hegel has said that the object of our life is self-determination. We must determine our normal function in the organic whole—not mere emancipation from the negative side but participation in a positive function in the domain of service. This is considered to be the highest attainment of life. This is the real meaning of gāyatrī."},{"class":"b44","text":" The word <span class=\\"e3\\">gāyatrī</span> comes from two Sanskrit roots: <span class=\\"e3\\">gānat</span> and <span class=\\"e3\\">trāyate</span>. <span class=\\"e3\\">Trāyate</span> means positive attainment to the final stage (<span class=\\"e3\\">svarūpena vyavasthitiḥ</span>). And <span class=\\"e3\\">gānat</span> means not mere sound, but musical sound. That musical sound which grants us the highest positive deliverance indicates the saṅkīrtan of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu and the flute-song of Śrī Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" The purport of the Brahma-gāyatrī-mantra is as follows: The first word is <span class=\\"e3\\">Om</span>. <span class=\\"e3\\">Om</span> is the seed mantra which contains everything within it.

Bhuvaloka is the world of mental acquisition. It is the support, the background of our experience. Our present position of experience is the effect of our mental acquisition. That we are here in the world of experience is not an accident; we have acquired this position by our previous karma. The physical sphere, this present world of experience, is only the product, the outcome of our previous mental impulses.

The mental world (Bhuvaloka) means acceptance and rejection: what to do and what not to do—“I like this, I don’t like that.” Svaloka, however, is the plane of decision, the world of intelligence (Buddhiloka). Our intelligence tells us, “You may like this, but don’t do that, for then you will be the loser.” That plane, the plane of reason, is known as Svaloka. In this way, this material world is composed of three general layers, Bhū, the physical world, Bhuva, the mental world, and Sva, the intellectual world."},{"class":"b44","text":" Of course, a more detailed analysis will reveal seven layers: Bhū, Bhuva, Sva, Maha, Jana, Tapa, and Satyaloka.

It is the soul who gives light to this world, who gives us an understanding of the environment, the world of perception. All perception is possible only because of the soul.

Here soul means individual soul. The individual soul is the cause of his world. Not that the mind is in the world, but the world is in the mind. Berkeley has said that the world is in the mind. Here it is being expressed that everything is seen with the help of the sun. If there is no sun, everything is dark—nothing can be seen. So without light, nothing can be seen.

That is the Supersoul area."},{"class":"b44","text":" That worshippable plane of transcendental existence is known as <span class=\\"e3\\">bhargo</span>. <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhargo</span> means the supersubjective area, the area of the Supersoul. This is mentioned in the first verse of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>: <span class=\\"e3\\">dhāmnā svena sadā nirasta-kuhakaṁ satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi</span>. Śrīla Vyāsadev says that here he is going to deal with another world whose pristine glory is so great that by its own ray, all misconceptions are brushed aside. The subject is the soul, and its object is all these worlds of experience. And the supersubject is the venerable area which is superior to the subject, the soul—that is the supersubjective area."},{"class":"b44","text":" The word <span class=\\"e3\\">bhargo</span> means “more subtle than the soul” and “holding a more important position than the soul”. So this means the Supersoul, the Paramātmā. In general, of course, the word <span class=\\"e3\\">bhargo</span> ordinarily means light. Just as an X-ray can show us what the ordinary eye cannot see, <span class=\\"e3\\">bhargo</span> is svarūp-śakti: higher, more powerful light that can reveal the soul. And that energy—<span class=\\"e3\\">bhargo</span>—belongs to whom? It belongs to Deva. What is the meaning of the word <span class=\\"e3\\">deva</span>? <span class=\\"e3\\">Deva</span> means “who is beautiful and playful”, that is, Śrī Kṛṣṇa: Reality the Beautiful. He is not a nondifferentiated substance but is full of līlā, Pastimes. <span class=\\"e3\\">Deva</span> means Pastimes and beauty combined, and this means Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" His domain is <span class=\\"e3\\">bhargo</span>, brilliant, and it is <span class=\\"e3\\">vareṇyaṁ</span>, to be venerated by the jīva-soul. What is the nature of the svarūp-śakti? It is the vaibhava, the extension of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. She holds the full service responsibility and the energy to serve Kṛṣṇa. <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhargo</span> is no less than the vaibhava, the extended body of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, which contains everything for the service of Kṛṣṇa. <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhargo</span> represents Mahābhāva, the predominated moiety, and Deva, Kṛṣṇa, is Rasarāj, the predominating moiety."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the gāyatrī-mantra, we are requested, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Bhargo devasya dhīmahi</span>: come meditate.” What sort of meditation is possible in that plane of dedication? Not abstract meditation, but service cultivation, Kṛṣṇānuśīlanam. <span class=\\"e3\\">Dhīmahi</span> means “to participate in the spontaneous flow, the current of devotion in Vṛndāvan”. And what will be the result? <span class=\\"e3\\">Dhiyo yo naḥ prachodayāt</span>: the capacity of our cultivation will be increased. As we serve, a greater capacity and willingness to serve will be given to us in remuneration—just as interest is added to capital in the bank (<span class=\\"e3\\">dāsa kari’ vetana more deha prema-dhana</span>). In this way, our dedicating principle will be increased again and again. <span class=\\"e3\\">Dhīmahi</span> means ārādhana, worship. It cannot but be explained in terms of ārādhana, pūjā, sevā—worship, adoration, loving service. The word <span class=\\"e3\\">dhī</span> is derived from the word <span class=\\"e3\\">buddhi</span>, which generally means “that which we cultivate with the help of our intelligence”. But here, <span class=\\"e3\\">dhī</span> is a reference to that venerable intelligence which descends into this plane to help us cultivate service. So, <span class=\\"e3\\">dhīmahi</span> does not mean abstract meditation, but devotional service. This is the underlying meaning of the gāyatrī-mantra."},{"class":"b44","text":" Gāyatrī, the song for deliverance, also means saṅkīrtan. Kīrtan is also sung, and it also improves us towards the highest goal. The saṅkīrtan of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu also reinstates us in our highest serving position. So, Brahma-gāyatrī in connection with Mahāprabhu comes to mean Kṛṣṇa-kīrtan. Then it reaches Vṛndāvan and the flute-kīrtan. And when we enter Vṛndāvan, we shall find that the sweet sound of Kṛṣṇa’s flute helps to engage all the Lord’s servants in their respective duties. When the flute is sounded, the gopīs and others are adjusted in their respective duties. At night, the gopīs, hearing the sound of the flute, will run to the Yamunā, thinking, “Oh, Kṛṣṇa is there.” And when Yaśodā hears the song of Kṛṣṇa’s flute, she thinks, “My son is there. He is coming home soon.” In this way, the sound of the flute engages all the servants of the Lord in their respective positions and inspires them to be mindful of their service."},{"class":"b44","text":" In my Sanskrit commentary on the gāyatrī-mantra, I have written, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Dhīr ārādhanam eva nānyad iti tad Rādhā-padaṁ dhīmahi</span>: all other services are represented fully in Rādhikā.” Like branches they are all part of Her.

And what is our service? Our service must be to surrender ourselves in the service of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī—to accept the suggestion of Rādhārāṇī. The gāyatrī-mantra will excite us to be mindful about Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s lotus feet, to obey Her orders. She is mainly representing the whole serving area. So, to try to engage ourselves in Her service, under Her order—to accept Her direction and to obey Her—that is the service of Śrī Rādhā. In this way, the meaning of the gāyatrī-mantra has been drawn to rādhā-dāsyam, self-determination (<span class=\\"e3\\">svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</span>)."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the meantime, the partial representations in vātsalya and sakhya-rasa are also part and parcel of the original mellow of conjugal love, madhura-rasa.

Rādhārāṇī is the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu. So, I selected the word <span class=\\"e3\\">bhānu</span>. To represent Her personal extended self, I have given the word <span class=\\"e3\\">vaibhava</span>. <span class=\\"e3\\">Vaibhava</span> means, “what comes out” or “extended self”. Prābhava is the central representation and vaibhava is the outer extension. The very gist of svarūp-śakti is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, and the whole svarūp-śakti is Her extended self.

To help Her in serving Her Lord, they all come out. When the entire internal energy is condensed in a concise form, it is Mahābhāva, Rādhārāṇī. And when Rādhārāṇī wants to serve, She extends Herself in limitless different ways. And with some contribution from Baladev and Yogamāyā, the whole spiritual world, including Vṛndāvan, Mathurā, and Vaikuṇṭha, evolves to assist Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī in the service of Śrī Kṛṣṇa."},{"class":"b44","text":" In this way, I have drawn out Rādhā-dāsyam, the service of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, as the meaning of the gāyatrī-mantra and have tried to represent it in Sanskrit verse."},{"class":"b52","text":" Gauraharibol!"}]},{"title":"About The Author","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b47","text":" About The Author"},{"class":"b43","text":" His Divine Grace Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj was born in Hapaniya, West Bengal, India in 1895.
