Mahāprabhu appeared in Śrī Māyāpur and played here in the nine islands of Nabadwīp: Antardwīp, Sīmantadwīp, Godrumadwīp, Madhyadwīp, Koladwīp, Modadrumadwīp, Rudradwīp, Jahnudwīp, and Ṛtudwīp.

Everything is always covered by illusion, māyā, and to our eyes this Nabadwīp Dhām is also covered by that illusion. There are two types of māyā: Yogamāyā and Mahamāyā. Yogamāyā is always giving nourishment to her Lord, whereas Mahāmāyā prevents any disturbance from entering that plane."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our soul is now covered by illusion: we are attracted by the chhāyā-śakti, the shadow-power of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, we now live far from that transcendental world. But when Kṛṣṇa will bestow His mercy upon our head, Māyā will remove the illusion from us, we will be able to see the transcendental Dhām, and we shall also be able to serve there."},{"class":"b44","text":" The māyā-śakti is very heavy for us because we are very tiny souls. She is always attracting us through her illusion. In one way, it is for our rectification, no doubt, but it is not a happy position for the conditioned souls. However, we will get relief from this environment if we try to know our position and what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If we do this, then by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa and His devotee, we will get strength to come out from the illusory environment, and, when we try, Kṛṣṇa will help us. That assistance comes to us through His devotees."},{"class":"b44","text":" Everything comes through the proper channel.

Everywhere there is some possibility, from the lowest level up to the highest; everyone can try to give some good to others.

Somehow or other, you have received some experience and inspiration, and that is why you have come here, and you are trying to increase your mood of devotion as much as possible. Many devotees constantly feel disturbances from many things. From within themselves they are subject to kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mada, mātsarya: lust, anger, greed, illusion, madness, and jealousy. The only way to gain relief from such a position has been given by Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī Prabhu:"},{"class":"b59","text":" vācho vegaṁ manasaḥ krodha-vegaṁ<br />jihvā-vegam udaropastha-vegam<br />etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥ<br />sarvām apīmāṁ pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Upadeśāmṛta)"},{"class":"b43","text":" It is necessary to try to control these tendencies within us, and it is only possible through service.

Many of our friends always feel disturbances from their mundane activities.

Therefore, our activity, mood, and everything, whether viddhi or rāga, should always be such as to try to take us to that higher level.

If witches have us under their spell, then how can Kṛṣṇa-bhakti live there? Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī says it is not possible. Still, if we try with our best mood of service to attain that position, we must get it. It may be sudden or it may be after a long time, but if we try, we must get that position; there is no doubt. That attempt is called <span class=\\"e3\\">sādhana</span>. <span class=\\"e3\\">Sādhana</span> is ‘the means to the end’.

But the topmost position, and the actual need for our supreme transcendental benefit, is only bhakti-yoga. Without bhakti-yoga, other kinds of sādhana such as bhukti or mukti cannot give us the proper result. So, if we try to practise śravaṇam, kīrtanam, smaraṇam, vandanam, etc.—the nine kinds of bhakti sādhana under the guidance of a proper sādhu—then we will easily receive the good result."},{"class":"b44","text":" This navadhā-bhakti-pīṭha is Nabadwīp Dhām.

But if we really want that, then we should sincerely try to get it through the expert—then easily we can have His connection."},{"class":"b51","text":" In the scriptures we can see that Kṛṣṇa’s devotee always tries to satisfy the devotees. That position is the supermost position, but at present we are living in another position, that is, the mano-jagat, which means the mental world, and that mental world has grown up from the māyā-jagat, the illusory environment.

But the line of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj is a very exclusive devotional line."},{"class":"b44","text":" If we want to serve Śrīla Guru Mahārāj exclusively and not see anything else, we will be relieved of all troubles. We must try to serve Guru very attentively, for only then will we get that chance. Otherwise, we will be cheated. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was very simple-hearted. He did not want to cheat anyone, and that is why he did not make many complications. In his life he only showed Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa-bhakti. We are also trying to proceed within the line of his vision, but if his mercy will not act within us, we will not get that. So, in an exclusive way we must try to satisfy Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Then he will be very happy."},{"class":"b44","text":" Under the guidance of our mind we may try many things, but that is not really bhakti. Our mind is always going this way and that way. The fickle and mad mind can do anything, but a good result will not always come from that. If we do good things, then a good result will come to us. If we do not, then a bad result will come to us; such is our position. We will gain relief from the illusory environment only if in an exclusive way we try to follow our Gurudev."},{"class":"b51","text":" Many people can say many things; also the śāstras are very vast! All the scriptures are full of knowledge no doubt, but they are so vast that we cannot discover from them what is good for us. But the sādhu, Guru, and the Vaiṣṇavas simply try to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, and if we follow them, we will easily get the full result of all scriptural advice. Therefore, we shall try to proceed in a simple way.

What service can they do? We tell them that they can help the Maṭh in various ways and give some service donation, and in this way engage themselves in connection with here. But especially in the West, life is very full and there is always the opportunity of complete engagement in māyā; there are newspapers, television, radio, etc. The devotees have their work, their family, and so many things. So they want to know how they can feel they have a constant sevā connection; some bhakti connection going on daily. As well as giving to and helping the Central Maṭh, what can they do?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj:</span> I am thinking they know better than myself—that is, they are doing it, and they are trying to serve! Still, it is true: how will they feel connected? In which way will they serve? And what is that service?"},{"class":"b44","text":" It is necessary first to surrender to Śrī Guru and the Vaiṣṇavas, and second, to follow their directives. Service is: “What they advise me to do—I will do that.” And, what is necessary for the satisfaction of Guru? Guru is always giving some instructions to the disciple, and if the disciple tries to serve his Guru accordingly, then he will receive the desired result. If my Guru will say, “You preach village to village”, and if I go village to village, that will be service for me. If Gurudev says, “You try to make a centre here for preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness”, and I try to do that with heart and soul, that is my practising life. Everything depends on the satisfaction of Guru."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the same way, where there is no Guru present but other Vaiṣṇavas are there, service to the Vaiṣṇava will also go to Guru, and he will be pleased by that. The Guru must be perfect. Otherwise, the result will not come out perfectly. So when the devotees are working in their country, they should try to follow the instructions of Guru. They will try within their circumstances to do as much as possible for the satisfaction of Guru and Vaiṣṇava. Otherwise, what will they do?"},{"class":"b44","text":" Everyone everywhere spends their life for eating, sleeping, enjoying, fearing, and protecting themselves, and then dying—taking birth and dying. But that is not really life."},{"class":"b44","text":" Real life is that we can do something of eternal value. If anyone can do something in connection with the eternal world, they will receive an eternal result. That connection comes through transcendental knowledge, consciousness, and activity, so we have no other way than to follow the instructions of Guru."},{"class":"b44","text":" If I think the eternal life is good and I want it, I must follow my instructor. If he is a perfect devotee, what he will say will be good for me. Otherwise, if my instructor is not perfect, the result also may not be good."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, East or West, South or North, everywhere it is necessary to follow Gurudev as perfectly as possible. ‘Follow’ means that his order is sufficient for me: “Do this, and you’ll be satisfied.” But strong faith is necessary there. Otherwise, it will not be possible to follow in a perfect way."},{"class":"b51","text":" Everything is connected with faith. The Guru is connected with the faithful plane, and when he will give that connection to his disciple, that is also within the faithful plane. Otherwise, so many things can give an auspicious result and a pious future birth, but bhakti is not of that character."},{"class":"b60","text":" bhaktis tu bhagavad-bhakta-saṅgena parijāyate"},{"class":"b43","text":" It will grow with the activity of the ātmā, so now our activity will be to follow the practitioner’s life."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, Śrīla A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Prabhupād, said, “First you chant the mahāmantra without counting; then chant by counting on beads; then take Hari-nām. Before taking Hari-nām, you must first practise for six months or one year.” But actually this is not the real position of the practitioner. The real process is that when you get the beads from a perfect Guru, from there you will get the power of the mantra—the mahāmantra—and his order will give you strength to chant. If you engage attentively in that chanting, you will get a good result. But when he wanted to advise the general mass to chant, but they did not know anything—they had not even heard ‘Hare Kṛṣṇa’ before—what was he to do? Some sort of practising was necessary."},{"class":"b44","text":" When a young boy first tries to write something, he just makes a mark or a line, then he gradually gains some finer control of his hand, and soon we can see an ‘A’ or a ‘B’ taking its proper form. Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj tried to encourage the Westerners in this way, and no doubt it is one kind of process. It depends upon the mood of the practitioners, and if they will get some clear feelings, then immediately they will try to chant the mahāmantra perfectly, and at that time help will come from the upper level—Kṛṣṇa will help in the form of Guru."},{"class":"b44","text":" So for one who is very active and tries always to be engaged, the instructions of Guru give some work to him, and through that work his mood to practise and increase his bhakti-yoga will develop. That work can itself immediately be in the category of bhakti-yoga. If someone can practise properly, and if his inner hankering wants that, immediately that job can be transformed into bhakti."},{"class":"b44","text":" Everything depends on the mood of the devotee. Someone may go for collection, someone else may cook, another may clean, but everything depends on the individual’s mood whether it will be karma or bhakti. If someone will follow his Guru’s instructions in a surrendered mood, it will be bhakti. Otherwise, it will be pious karma. If anyone will follow the instructions of the scriptures and Guru, he will always receive a good result, but that is not necessarily bhakti. It is a big difficulty for everyone if they are not conscious of their purpose. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj always emphasised the word ‘consciousness’—everything is living within consciousness."},{"class":"b51","text":" The result depends on the devotee’s mental position.

If we need bhakti-yoga to Kṛṣṇa, and if we do not want to stay within the illusory environment, and if we feel the necessity to go to the transcendental world—our own home—then with full heart we must try to achieve that. We shall try to search out that place where it is available and whole-heartedly try to follow the instructions we receive there. This is the main thing for everyone, but circumstances can take us in many ways and to many places. We must try to proceed steadily within our track and not allow ourselves to go out of the track. This is our necessity."},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Devotee:</span> Mahārāj, I have a question.

Also after Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, some are going out of track. But why?"},{"class":"b44","text":" It depends upon their sukṛti—their spiritual fortune. We see that they served Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj or they served Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, but actually they did not get the proper way, the real service connection. At that time, however, by the influence of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, that shortcoming was covered. The disciples did many activities enthusiastically, but they actually did not know what devotional service is. When Gurudev disappeared, his influence of covering the shortcoming in the disciples also withdrew with him. At that time some of the devotees got back their previous subtle position, and they became confused. Ultimately, it depends upon their own karma, their good fortune, and also the quality of their practising life—these three will contribute towards a good result."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is necessary for the devotees to know very clearly what they want to practise, then they will not go off the track, and in that also their own good fortune and good activities are necessary. Otherwise, they will not reach their goal. We must be able to recognise what is what. It is a fact that even when Kṛṣṇa was present, not everyone could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śiśupāl and Dantavakra had the chance to be with Kṛṣṇa, but they could not understand who He was. Also many saw Kṛṣṇa on the battlefield of Kurukṣetra, but they did not understand that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So some fortune must work behind ‘seeing’."},{"class":"b44","text":" After Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj left, the illusory environment came with more force. When Kṛṣṇa left from this mundane world, at that time also the illusory environment again asserted itself strongly. Whenever a great soul disappears, some disturbance is caused by the illusory environment, and it tries to catch and conquer the heart of the weak devotees—not only the weak devotees, but the good workers also. It will try to conquer them. But those who are fully surrendered to their Guru will not be captured by that illusion, and those who are good followers will also not fall into that illusion. Those who are not settled within their own track will easily leave their position, and to some degree this has happened."},{"class":"b44","text":" We can live with a sādhu and take his association, but we may not get real sādhu-saṅga merely by living with him. Bugs may live in the bed of a sādhu; lice may even be so close to him that they live in his hair and take his blood, but they are not engaged in sādhu-saṅga! So, the unfortunate souls leave the track. Otherwise, the true path is a very easy thing."},{"class":"b44","text":" One instruction Śrīla Guru Mahārāj used to always give me when I first came to him was: “What I shall instruct, you will follow, and what your mind will say, you don’t follow.” But I thought, “My mind is not always giving me bad advice, sometimes it is giving good suggestions to me.” But Śrīla Guru Mahārāj told me not to follow even what I thought was the good advice of my mind. “That means you must fully depend upon me. My need is that you must fully depend upon me.” Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said in this way, “What does your mind tell you? You think it sometimes says good advice and it sometimes says bad. But you are not to follow even the apparently good advice. If you take the association of your mind, you must give some return to him. Therefore, it is not necessary to take the association of your mind. Instead, take my instruction for yourself.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" It is a very easy instruction, but we cannot always follow it. Therefore, we receive some trouble. When we forget Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s order, we receive much trouble. Behind this, two things are acting: one is fortune and the other is our activity. Good fortune is necessary, and that comes through sevā. Good fortune grows through sevā. One who can do real sevā will receive a good result. However, one who does ‘sevā’ but is always thinking about his own interest must be ignored by bhakti, and bhakti will not go to him. He may live so long and stay for many years in the Gauḍīya Mission, but he may not get that bhakti."},{"class":"b44","text":" There are many examples not only in the Gauḍīya Mission, but such disturbances can be seen everywhere in history. It is present in Christianity, in Mohammedanism, etc. And in Hinduism there are many channels: Śrī Rāmānuja, Śaṅkar Āchārya, etc."},{"class":"b44","text":" There is a famous story of how one day Rāmānuja Āchārya’s sannyāsī disciples quarrelled over something which appeared very big, but actually was very small. It was a very small matter, but they quarrelled fiercely. Someone had moved around the clothes the sannyāsīs were to wear. One of them became very disturbed, and a quarrel began. Rāmānuja then showed through the example of a gṛhastha devotee how one should serve his Guru. In the scriptures we can see this and many other examples. Śaṅkar Āchārya also showed a similar example."},{"class":"b44","text":" Actually, our spiritual journey depends upon clear consciousness. One who has some clear consciousness from his Guru will not leave the track. Otherwise, everyone has some possibility of deviating."},{"class":"b51","text":" It is necessary to stay within the proper line of knowledge. We must have the conviction, “We shall follow our Guru blindly.” We hear from many places that, “What our Guru gave is sufficient; it is not necessary to take advice from others.” And it is mainly very true. If I have no big idea, and no big, wide vision, then I must follow my Gurudev in a very simple way. Sometimes that will work very nicely, but it is not always true, because if a Guru will say one thing, or give one advice, then there is no doubt that if there are five disciples, each will take it in a slightly different way. Each of their minds will play upon that idea in a slightly different manner, so they will understand it in five ways. Maybe in the beginning they were not very different from each other, but whatever small differences exist will become more prominent as it comes down through three or four generations. By that time it may even become completely separate from Śrī Gurudev’s conception. <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> has mentioned:"},{"class":"b60","text":" evaṁ prakṛti-vaichitryād bhidyante matayo-nṛṇām<br />pāramparyeṇa keṣāñchit pāṣaṇḍa-matayo ’pare"},{"class":"b43","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj has given a very good example of this: thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. When Guru gives some knowledge, that is the thesis, but when that knowledge has come out from Gurudev, an antithesis must also come out from some other quarter. With the thesis, the antithesis will also grow, side by side. And synthesis comes when both will come into harmony. The synthesis then becomes established as the thesis, and again an antithesis will grow to oppose it. In this way, if five disciples hear from one Guru, five kinds of ideas will grow. Their ideas also depend upon their sukṛti. If they do not go off the track, we can say they have good sukṛti, and that sukṛti comes through their service. Therefore, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said, “What I shall instruct, you follow that, and what your mind will say, don’t follow it!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" It was for this reason that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj did not recommend us to read many things. Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur also discouraged much reading. Also, especially for those in the Maṭh, there is no excess time for reading. Our time is all service time. There is no excess time in our hand, so how shall we try to earn ‘other knowledge’ and how can we spend our time for collecting that knowledge?"},{"class":"b44","text":" Someone is studying in Sanskrit, someone in Bengali, someone else is studying in English—and spending time. They are showing a post-dated cheque, that, “After getting that knowledge, I shall serve!” But before that it is possible you may die, so why don’t you think like that? Therefore, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj did not give us the chance to study."},{"class":"b44","text":" At first Śrīla Guru Mahārāj did give some chance to me because I was unqualified. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj gave me some opportunity to study, but when some proper knowledge came to me, then Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said it was sufficient: “It is not necessary to read more. Now you do sevā.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" We tried to do sevā as much as possible, heart and soul, and we have seen that gradually everything is revealing itself in our heart. We are not trying to collect knowledge from the scriptures. I read <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā</span> only a few years ago, but I joined over forty-five years ago! It was just during the last days of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj that I read <span class=\\"e3\\">Brahma-saṁhitā</span>."},{"class":"b44","text":" One day I put the question to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj: “Mahārāj, in which way does the jīva-soul come out from the taṭasthā-śakti?” I heard the reply many times, but I could not catch it, so I again questioned Śrīla Guru Mahārāj: “The creation of the world, and the creation of the jīvas—in which way does it happen, Mahārāj? Again please explain this to me.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said, “Oh-oh, have you not read <span class=\\"e3\\">Brahma-saṁhitā</span>?” I replied, “No, Guru Mahārāj, I have not read it.” I knew many ślokas from <span class=\\"e3\\">Brahma-saṁhitā</span>, having heard them from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, but I had not read the book. Then Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said, “Read it and you will see the answer to your question very clearly explained there in the first section.” He also gave a brief explanation."},{"class":"b44","text":" That question was very difficult. The jīva-soul is transcendental, but the māyā-śakti produces material things. Her activity is always within the material world, but the jīva is transcendental, and Kṛṣṇa is transcendental. So in which way can the transcendental and material combine together to produce the creation? That was the question. But Śrīla Guru Mahārāj replied with this śloka: <span class=\\"e3\\">Tal-liṅgaṁ Bhagavān Śambhur</span>. Kṛṣṇa throws the vision, and prakṛti is impregnated: <span class=\\"e3\\">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-charācharam</span> (<span class=\\"e3\\">Bg</span>: 9.10). And in the middle position, that ‘throwing’ is done by Śambhu. That is his position."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj instructed, “Read <span class=\\"e3\\">Brahma-saṁhitā</span>. You will be able to see everything explained there.” And when I read <span class=\\"e3\\">Brahma-saṁhitā,</span> I was surprised to see: “Oh, all knowledge is inside this book, but I did not read it before. The whole of the knowledge that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj is giving us—everything is contained here.” Then the idea came to me that we must try to publish this <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā</span> and we shall distribute it to everyone."},{"class":"b44","text":" Actually, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj emphasised service to Guru and the Vaiṣṇavas, and by their mercy that knowledge will reveal itself in our heart. We can say that now we know something of the news of the transcendental world. ‘Know’ means ‘feel’. We can say we have some feeling, and by following the process, you must also get those feelings."},{"class":"b44","text":" I believe that everyone has some feelings. Otherwise, they cannot come in this line, especially in the Maṭh of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj—the line of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. The devotees have feelings, but perhaps they cannot always feel them clearly. Feelings must sometimes come to all of you. Otherwise, it is not possible to remain in this devotional track. But the main thing in the teachings of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj is to serve the Vaiṣṇavas, and to follow your Guru. In this way you will get everything."},{"class":"b44","text":" Many disciples of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj lived within his Mission. When they came in the line of Śrīman Mahāprabhu, they were very fortunate no doubt, but later their activities sometimes caused them much trouble. Sometimes they did not know what was what and sometimes they did not receive guidelines directly from their Guru. They had heard some things, but not others, so they lost the proper devotional temperament, and what they were doing began to go in the chamber of karma, but not in the chamber of sevā. In that way they thought, “We are satisfied. This is transcendental knowledge!” Easily some of them were cheated by Māyā."},{"class":"b44","text":" One who always thinks, “There exists more than this, and I need that”, and who always tries to search for it and get it, such a person will not be cheated."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the time of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, everything went on under his influence, and at that time very few could understand what their actual position was. He told: “I am ISKCON; you follow me”, and they tried to follow him but they did not know which part they should follow, this part or that part! As his mission became larger, the devotees’ mood of service was not always steady. It was a great difficulty for many of them. Sometimes they were very sad, sometimes very enthusiastic—many stages are there. The different stages a devotee goes through are given in the scriptures: utsāha-mayī, ghana-taralā, vyūḍha-vikalpā, viṣaya-saṅgarā, niyamākṣamā, and taraṅga-raṅgiṇī."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the beginning the practitioners feel much enthusiasm and do many types of service, but later their service mood goes flat. Then some wave may come in their mind, and by that wave some mood of suspicion arises. After that comes some connection with the plane of mundane enjoyment and, side by side with it, a connection with the transcendental world. They then become somewhat confused. Crossing that stage, first niṣṭhā, steadiness, and then ruchi, taste, comes and they gain more strength. At that stage all hindrances go behind them, and they can proceed steadily. These stages of devotion are explained in the scriptures."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, we may feel or see outwardly that someone may be doing sevā, service, but it is not always actual service. Sevā gives more sevā, so why is more sevā not coming? Seeing the symptoms, we can say that some were not doing actual sevā. Therefore, after the disappearance of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj and Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, they underwent some difficulty."},{"class":"b51","text":" We must be conscious, therefore, about our position and about our service.

All the scholars there were defeated by him. The next day, the final meeting was supposed to take place, and the King would have been forced to introduce the Vedic way of worship.

So Mahāprabhu instructed Jagadānanda, “Don’t go upon Govardhan Hill, and when you stay in Vṛndāvan, you must stay with Rūpa Goswāmī and Sanātan Goswāmī. Under their guidance no problem will arise, and there will be less chance to make offence. If you stay with them, you will not make any offence there. Staying with Rūpa-Sanātan is also a great responsibility, but by My order you can stay there securely and follow their guidance.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Later there was a Pastime where Jagadānanda became very angry with Sanātan—but that is their līlā.

Follow Rūpa and Sanātan Goswāmī, not by imitating their practising life, their sādhana, but by following their directives.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The scriptures advise us, “You must follow what Kṛṣṇa says, but you are not to try to imitate what He does.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The advice of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> is, “Do not even think to imitate Kṛṣṇa or His powerful devotees.

But if anyone can increase the quantity while keeping the quality, that is very, very good."},{"class":"b44","text":" We can also see from another angle. When Gurudev gives Hari-nām initiation, at that time the disciple promises, “Yes I shall chant such a specified number of rounds (whether four, sixteen, sixty-four, etc.)”, but to fail to keep their vow will go in the category of offence against Guru. In that way it is some relief to the devotees to have a minimum of just four rounds daily. On the whole all Their Divine Graces have the right to adjust their instruction according to the environment, the situation, and the capacity of the devotees. Anyhow, the vital point is that we are to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa as much as possible—without offence, with sincerity, and with love, and to serve Guru-Vaiṣṇava and their mahāprasādam whole-heartedly."},{"class":"b44","text":" About the four directives, we are always mentioning them here in India, but on my recent world tour I sometimes did not mention them—I am thinking that everyone in the West is conscious about the four directives.

Those Vaiṣṇavas are recommending them; that is, I do not know anything about them but I am giving my service initiation to the recommended sincere seekers. (Actually, the directives are not four, but five, and those four directives are living automatically within the fifth. However, for the innocent newcomers we must advise that they follow the four directives no doubt.)"},{"class":"b51","text":" But here is also some vital point that we must not forget (even though it may not be for public mass-distribution): that is that the position of the real and exclusive devotee of Kṛṣṇa is above the rules, and such devotees can come from anywhere and everywhere.

In those earlier days when Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj established the now exalted ‘International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness’, his Mission was always receiving proper nourishment through his divine association. Perhaps everything was not going fully perfectly, but on the whole we can say that his Mission was the only hope for the Western world to happily practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is true that after his disappearance some disturbance came in his beloved ISKCON Mission, and it is a very usual thing. In every mission everywhere it must be expected that when the exalted sun is going to set, some illusory environment will try to influence over all that mission. I cannot say that in Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj’s time there was no influence of illusion, but by his divine power everything was immediately harmonised."},{"class":"b44","text":" Everybody will try to make his mission perfect, and I think all the auspicious and great Āchāryas in this world tried to make their missions perfect and spent their whole energy for that.

Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said, “Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj is a Śaktyāveś-avatār; otherwise, no man can make such a mission all over the world within five years.” In a very short time he widely gave the chance to receive the supreme goal of life: unalloyed devotion to Kṛṣṇa in the line of Śrīman Mahāprabhu."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the time of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj whenever news would come from any corner of the world of the many persons chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra and practising pure devotional life, at that time I saw the face of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj to be greatly exalted, and he openly praised Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj’s divine activities and glories in front of everybody. I also saw his similar divine expression whenever Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj would come and report his missionary news to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. They were both very great, and their basic discussion was very high and harmonious about spreading real Kṛṣṇa consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj himself selected a few leaders for maintaining and spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world for his Mission—that was called the “G.B.C.”—and he was proud of them. At that time my own feelings were non-different from ISKCON, and I was very happy to see the mood of the devotees. I did not get the chance to mix with everybody—it was also not possible—but I was surprised to see the depth of knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in those I saw. Actually, I received much nice impression and enthusiasm from them including Śrīpād Bhāvānanda Mahārāj, Śrīpād Tamal Kṛṣṇa Mahārāj, Śrīpād Achyutānanda Prabhu, etc. I still have many friends in the ISKCON society, and they have a very good mood. They are living within the preaching and practising life, and I highly respect them."},{"class":"b44","text":" But you know that after the disappearance of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj many things have happened in that society. Not only that, but many of the great, great devotee personalities showed their very unfortunate form, and that was painful for their followers and many of the followers of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, and it was very painful for myself also. Those confused persons eagerly sought secure shelter for their spiritual life, but they could no longer fully trust others in that society. At the same time they did not want to leave Kṛṣṇa consciousness because living in their hearts was the seed of Kṛṣṇa consciousness planted by Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj often said, “I am ISKCON.” That means that all the property of Kṛṣṇa consciousness—the Society he formed—was living with him, and he could not tolerate that any disturbance will come to his preaching life, and he would try to remove such disturbances by any means. But after His Divine Grace’s disappearance, some wave of illusion in the form of ego immediately tried to spread bad influence. You know that many have been affected by that influence. By those infected persons’ power, many good souls were ousted, and Śrīla Guru Mahārāj tried to give them some hope and shelter in the form of relief work. At present I am trying to serve his divine chair to the best of my limited capacity."},{"class":"b44","text":" Actually, Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj organised the ISKCON society so there can be practising of Kṛṣṇa consciousness under proper guardianship, and that is the only goal of life for all conditioned souls. This is not only the preaching of His Divine Grace, but it is also the preaching of Śrīman Mahāprabhu, His associates, and the preceptorial line after Him. No doubt it has manifest in the world at large, especially in the West, through Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, but the many disciples of Śrīla Saraswatī Ṭhākur and our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj continued according to their own capacity to preach and practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We see everywhere that each do not have the identical preaching method and mood of Śrīman Mahāprabhu: <span class=\\"e3\\">tṛnād api sunīchena taror api sahiṣṇunā, amāninā mānadena</span>… and they were not all free from Vaiṣṇava-aparādh. Therefore, many difficulties arise in every society, and even our society is not fully free from that."},{"class":"b44","text":" We need to do good for ourselves and for others. We want to leave the ideal of mundanity and we must try to achieve the super-beneficial transcendental service-plane—which is really our life’s goal—through chanting the mahāmantra without offence in the association of devotees, and preaching. The chanting without offence is so very essential, and if that feeling does not come to us, we will not get the proper beneficial results. I feel that this is very important for us now."},{"class":"b44","text":" I heard a phrase in English from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, “The rank is but the guinea-stamp, man is the gold for that.” Actually, an institution or sampradāya is like the guinea-stamp, but the real value is to be found in the quality of the gold—wherever it is to be found—otherwise, only in its own particular country will the value certified by the guinea-stamp be given."},{"class":"b44","text":" In another way we can say, <span class=\\"e3\\">svadeśe pūjyate rājā vidvān sarvatra pūjyate</span>. Qualified persons have value everywhere, but if a King is not qualified, he will only receive honour in his own kingdom. We can also see many nicely designed uniforms displayed in shop-windows.

If we can have both the man and the designed uniform, that will be very good for us."},{"class":"b44","text":" I am always trying to harmonise with all environments and I never advise anyone to make any disturbance or offence to others.

Not only that, but Śrīman Mahāprabhu Himself did not give such things, because they are not for mass distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is that they gave everything about Kṛṣṇa consciousness no doubt, but not for everybody. Also, all are not qualified to receive that.

It is my prayer to everyone to try to take to heart the teachings of all our predecessor Āchāryas for the real benefit and progress of everyone in a harmonious way.

He has not even the smallest idea about Kṛṣṇa consciousness, especially about the twelve years of Mahāprabhu’s living in Gambhīrā and the mood of Rādhārāṇī tasted by Mahāprabhu, the non-different form of Kṛṣṇa. Can you say what kind of destination awaits such a person? If the residents of hell see such a person, they must be fearful of him and need to make a new hell for him."},{"class":"b51","text":" We have taken refuge at the lotus feet of our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, and therefore Kṛṣṇa has been gracious to give us all protection from the concocted ideas of the foolish. If you read only Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s books and try to serve only in his line, you will be joyful and worry-free, and very quickly you will make progress on your transcendental homeward journey."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question: </span>I am running a purely vegetarian restaurant, but a devotee quoted you as saying that devotional service and business should not be mixed. He also implied that it isn’t proper to offer foodstuffs to Śrī Guru and Gaurāṅga before serving it out. I have a little trouble to understand this. Please say something on this matter for us."},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj:</span> Regarding your question, I can say that everything depends on the mood of the devotee. The mahābhāgavat can see everything to be prasādam. But the scripture also says that to give mahāprasādam to those who have no faith is an aparādh. By way of example, Hari-nām can rescue everyone, but if you give it to someone who has no faith, then it is an offence; in a similar way we can make aparādh to mahāprasādam. But it all depends on the mood of those involved: if in a fully conscious way, it is made and offered, then distributed to those with faith—that is very good."},{"class":"b51","text":" Mahāprasādam means mercy, and we are not to give that in exchange for money, but we can give it in exchange for faith. However, I am not criticising Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj; that is, I can harmonise it in another way: he wants to engage the whole world in the service of Kṛṣṇa, and he has the right to break and make the injunctions; that is, he is a Śaktyāveś-āvatār. We can adjust the mood of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj and the traditional rules in this way: where there is no other way to do service to Guru-Gaurāṅga, the devotees are doing business, being employed, distributing books, selling cookies, etc. Also running restaurants is one kind of business. So I can harmonise in this way, that after cooking you first offer a little of each preparation to Śrī Guru-Gaurāṅga, but not mix it back in with the remainder. Also, after taking for the maintenance of your family, you offer the profit money for the service of Śrī Guru-Vaiṣṇava, and in this way no reaction will come to you. That is, I say it all depends on the mood in which it is done. The main thing is that your existence must stand in the plane of service. If anyone with śraddhā wants that prasād, you can happily give it to him."},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question: </span>In the purport of verses 5.24 and 25 of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Brahma- saṁhitā</span> it is stated that the Gopāl mantra has two aspects: 1) To fulfil the pure spiritual desires of pure devotees, culminating in Kṛṣṇa-prema, and 2) To also fulfil the mundane desires of the mixed devotees."},{"class":"b51","text":" Considering myself a mixed devotee, I am asking you if I may chant this Gopāl mantra.

May I chant this Gopāl mantra like japa-mala, or in my mind incessantly?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj:</span> Regarding the Gopāl mantra, you can refer to this verse:"},{"class":"b60","text":" bhoga-mokṣa vāñchhā chhāḍi’ hari-nāma gāi re<br />nā cheye-o nāmera guṇe o saba phala pāi re"},{"class":"b43","text":" When we will chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahāmantra or meditate upon the Kṛṣṇa or Gopāl mantra without asking for anything except the transcendental service to Kṛṣṇa under guidance of Śrī Gurudev, that will be of real benefit for everybody, and what good things are needed for us will come automatically.

Is this true? Also, I hear from some that the jīva originally came from the spiritual world, but others say our origin is the marginal position. Dear Gurudev, please help me understand this."},{"class":"b51","text":" Also, please clarify as to whether I may visit other missions if I find their members to be respectful to my Śrīla Guru Mahārāj."},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj:</span> If anyone from Vaikuṇṭha comes to the material worlds, it is generally only by the will of the Lord. It is, however, given in the scriptures that even a resident of Vaikuṇṭha can fall down if he commits Vaiṣṇava-aparādh, but that also can be seen to be by the will of the Lord as in the case of the gatekeepers, Jaya and Vijay."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was many times approached with this question and he illustrated clearly that our origin is the marginal potency of the Lord, the taṭastha-śakti.

To hear criticism of Śrī Gurudev is very bad and must be avoided because it strikes at the foundation of spiritual wealth: faith in Śrī Guru. From another angle, anyone running a mission certainly faces many problems to keep the unity, so we must always be careful to respect that. And if others may not want us to visit their Temple, we will humbly agree to their wish and still keep our respect for those devotees."},{"class":"b51","text":" Ideally, we shall try to keep the association of those who are following our own track of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In this way various devotees are trying hard to make successful ashrams as places for our Maṭh’s devotees to associate happily."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question: </span>As you know, one devotee who was considered to be more senior has fallen away from your Mission here.

Many things are good in this world, no doubt, but one with exclusive mood will always focus on his own track—that means the books of our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, his instructions, practising method, etc.—and we will follow that. But as a business for the purpose of maintenance, we can consider presenting the books of others, as long as it is not harmful and that it does not differ from the conception of our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, but we cannot sell ourselves in exchange for anything in the mundane world. In this regard we can remember Śrīla Prabhupād Saraswatī Ṭhākur’s advice that we must tolerantly try to serve Śrī Guru-Gaurāṅga despite whatever may come. Love or rupture or anything may come, but we are to proceed in our track—that is very important."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question: </span>I have an enquiry about the worship of the Devas.

It is true that King Purañjana heard through the right ear, the south pañchāla, that means the karma-kāṇḍa fruitive activities under guidance of the Vedas, and it is that plane that Purañjana entered. This is given in the śloka of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> (4.25.50), but in that śloka another qualification is also given: that one can memorise very quickly, <span class=\\"e3\\">yāti śrutadharānvitaḥ</span>, just by once hearing, one can immediately memorise. In addition, Madhva Āchārya, our sampradāya Guru, said that through karma-kāṇḍa the jīva-soul may get a super chance by the karma if by good fortune he gets the opportunity of the super-servitor’s as devotees’ service. The left ear is a little weaker and it is mentioned to be a symbol of jñāna-kāṇḍa. In jñāna-kāṇḍa there is virtually no chance to get any service to the Vaiṣṇava devotees due to base ego. The final result they receive is Nirviśeṣloka, but this position must be avoided. In jñāna-kāṇḍa the main base is ego."},{"class":"b51","text":" Also in some places we find the left ear is mentioned, but Śrīla Guru Mahārāj instructed us to hear through the right ear; therefore, we are following that process."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question: </span>I am living so far away from the central Maṭh.

Also you can think it, that in the capital city of a country there are many duties that cannot be done there in the capital. The provinces, the smaller towns, and the villages all have their part to play in serving the centre. They grow paddy, vegetables, etc., spin cotton, make fabrics and clothing, keep cows, and produce milk, butter, yoghurt, etc., as well as many other duties. In this way all over the world’s fortunate souls can engage in service to the central Mission of our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj in unlimited ways.
