He was seated on a small mound in a lonely arbour of Śrī Godrum forest. As he cast his glance northward, the full moon rose, revealing an unprecedented beauty throughout the holy abode of Śrī Nabadwīp. A short distance away, Śrī Māyāpur became visible. Sannyāsī Ṭhākur exclaimed, “Oh! What is this wonder? I see an ecstatic holy place. There, constructed of precious jewels, are an effulgent palace, a Temple, and gateways. The entire bank of the Jāhnavī River is illuminated by their brilliance. In many places at once, a tumultuous roar of Hari-nām-saṅkīrtan is arising, vibrating through the skies. And now hundreds of devotees resembling the celestial sage Nārad are vibrating vīṇās, chanting the Holy Name, and dancing. Somewhere, the white-complexioned god of gods Mahādev is clutching his ḍambaru drum, crying, ‘O Viśvambhara, please give me Your mercy!’ Dancing in a mad frenzy, he now falls to the ground. Somewhere else, four-headed Lord Brahmā, seated in the assembly of Veda-reciting Rṣis, is singing the Vedic mantra:"},{"class":"b60","text":" mahān prabhur vai puruṣaḥ sattvasyaiṣa pravartakaḥ<br />sunirmalām imāṁ prāptim īśāno jyotir avyayaḥ"},{"class":"b43","text":" ‘The Supreme Person is Mahāprabhu; He alone is the source of our enlightenment.

Intoxicated by the ecstasy of Śrī Gaurachandra, Mother Nature extends her beauty all around. Lo! I never saw all these things in Śrī Māyāpur by day! What is this?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, remembering his Divine Master, he said, “My lord, I know well that you have given me your grace by extending unto me a divine vision of holy Māyāpur. From now on, I shall adopt a method to come out into the world as a member of the party of Śrī Gaurachandra. In this holy abode of Śrī Nabadwīp I see that everyone wears tulasī beads around their necks, and they decorate their bodies with the signs of tilak and the Holy Names.

He said, “O Vaiṣṇava Dās, today my ambitions are fulfilled by touching your auspicious form.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" By these words alone, Sannyāsī Ṭhākur’s previous name vanished. He now became known as ‘Vaiṣṇava Dās’. He had now attained something very special, a new lease of life.

The Vaiṣṇavas discussed spiritual matters amongst one another. The visiting Vaiṣṇavas circumambulated the holy tulasī tree and began to offer their prostrate obeisances to the resident Vaiṣṇavas. Just then, Vaiṣṇava Dās also circumambulated Śrī Vṛndā Devī and threw himself into the dust before the feet of the Vaiṣṇavas. Hearing the devotees’ remarks, some of the highly respected, elevated Vaiṣṇavas exclaimed, “He can’t be the same Sannyāsī Ṭhākur—what an amazing transformation!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Vaiṣṇava Dās rolled on the ground before them. Imploringly, he began to speak, “Today, my life’s mission is fulfilled. I have attained the dust of the feet of the Vaiṣṇavas. By the mercy of Śrī Gurudev, I have learned well that there is no refuge for the soul other than the dust of the feet of the Vaiṣṇavas. The foot-dust of the Vaiṣṇava, the nectarean water that washed the feet of the Vaiṣṇava, and the remnants of food left by the Vaiṣṇava—these three are the medicine for the disease of mundanity, and they are the healthy diet for those afflicted with this disease. Not only do they cure the disease, but they bestow the highest ecstasy upon the healthy souls."},{"class":"b52","text":" “O Vaiṣṇavas, please don’t think I am flaunting my scholarship. These days, my heart has become purged of egotism. I was born in a brāhmaṇ family, I studied all the scriptures, and I entered into the fourth order, the life of asceticism. Thus, the inflation of my ego has known no bounds. But since the day I became attracted to the principles of the Vaiṣṇavas, a seed of humility was planted within my heart. By the mercy of you all, I have gradually cast off the pride of my birth, the megalomania of my scholarship, and the grandeur of my ascetic status. Now, I find that I am a helpless, wretched soul. Other than the shelter of the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas, I have no refuge whatsoever. Brāhmaṇism, scholarship, and sannyās—these things were the cause of my downfall.

It is mentioned that they represent the nine sections of devotion:"},{"class":"b60","text":" śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam<br />archanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-nivedanam"},{"class":"b43","text":" Sīmantadwīp represents śravaṇa-bhakti, hearing about Kṛṣṇa. Chanting about Kṛṣṇa, kīrtan, is in Godrumadwīp; remembering the Lord, smaraṇam, is in Madhyadwīp; serving the Lord’s feet, pāda-sevanam, is here in Koladwīp; worshipping with ghee lamp, etc., archanam, is in Ṛtudwīp; offering prayers, vandanam, is in Jahnudwīp; rendering service as a servant, dāsyam, is in Modadrumadwīp; rendering service to the Lord in the relationship of a best friend, sakhyam, is in Rudradwīp; and full self-surrender, ātma-nivedanam, is represented in Śrī Antardwīp, Māyāpur. They have connection with these nine main types of devotional conceptions respectively. When travelling to these places, we are reminded by the incidents connected with them, how such representation comes from each place. All of them taken together promote our understanding as to what is devotion proper."},{"class":"b44","text":" Ātma-nivedanam, full self-surrender, is the basis of all. After ātma-nivedanam the plane of life will be categorically changed. After surrendering to the central direction, whatever will be done by us will come to have recognition as devotion. That is devotion. Ātma-nivedanam is selflessness plus self-surrendering. Self-surrendering presupposes selflessness. Selfish actions come to an end and selflessness is also crossed, and then self-surrendered life begins—and that is devotion proper."},{"class":"b51","text":" The life of a devotee has no individual or provincial interest. He works only for the universal interest of the Whole Absolute. Devotees are soldiers of that plane. Whatever they may do, the suggestion and inspiration comes from the centre, the Absolute Good. Though apparently they seem to be members of this plane of quarrel, in their heart their connection is with the Absolute Good; therefore, their colour has completely changed. The valuation of the devotees’ movements has completely changed although apparently they seem to be doing everything almost in a similar way to the mundane persons. Mundane persons eat, and the devotees also appear to eat, but actually they are not eating; they are rendering service to the remnants sent by the Lord. In this way they are going on."},{"class":"b60","text":" tvayopabhukta-srag-gandha-vāso- ’laṅkāra-charchitāḥ<br />uchchhiṣṭa-bhojino dāsās tava māyāṁ jayema hi"},{"class":"b43","text":" Uddhava says in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, “We shall conquer the whole of the deluding energy (Māyā) by only one thing.

Whatever You, O Lord, send to us, You have already taken and enjoyed, and we shall serve those remnants, and thereby the whole of the deluding energy will be devastated.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" One of my learned professor godbrothers was challenged by his younger brother who was perhaps a graduate, “What do you do there in the Maṭh?

What we do is beyond your understanding. We don’t eat like you. We have no spirit of consumption. We don’t consume anything, but we honour the remnants of the Lord.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Such will be the difference between all the activities of the true Vaiṣṇavas and the worldly men. Apparently, the Vaiṣṇavas seem to do the same things as others are doing: walking, sleeping, eating, engaging others in activities, earning money, spending, and so many apparently similar things, but the standpoint is totally different. It is connected with the centre. They abide by the direction of the central movement, whereas the worldly men are guided by their provincial, local interest. The difference is that one is guided by the local and the other by the Absolute, and that difference is very, very great. The Vaiṣṇavas are on the other side of selflessness, the other side of renounced life. Between the worldly men and the Vaiṣṇavas is the realm of complete renunciation. One is on one side; the other is on the other side."},{"class":"b44","text":" What proper devotion is must be realised. Generally, it may not be understood by the apparent movement of the devotees, but it is to be realised by the question of adjusting the angle of vision. The angle of vision is to be changed."},{"class":"b44","text":" There are so many incidents, stories, and sceneries connected with Śrī Nabadwīp Dhām Parikramā, but all are meaning to help us in our life of absolute adjustment. If one can catch that, then by his parikramā through different holy places and his hearing about local ‘historical’ incidents, he will receive eternal instructions in various conceptions of devotion. He will receive encouragement in this way."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is not like the parikramā of the ordinary people in the general Hindu section of society who also go out on pilgrimage. The general people come in contact with the holy places and they have some holy association, but their main object is to gain some unseen help in their present life. They want their desires of this present life to be satisfied by some invisible help from the demigods. It is puṇya-karma—to acquire good merit to help success in their present life according to their conception. It is not śuddha-bhakti."},{"class":"b51","text":" The objective of the Gauḍīya Maṭh people is quite different, and it cannot be reckoned in any of the different planes the present educational section are hunting for. The present-day scholars cannot even think that purely spiritual life is possible at all. They consider that spiritual life may be only a concoction that others are suffering from. According to the so-called scientific scholars, the spiritual searchers are fighting with their shadow, hunting after impossibility and imaginary things. They consider the devotees to be running after phantasmagoria and superstition."},{"class":"b59","text":" yā niśā sarva-bhūtānāṁ tasyāṁ jāgarti saṁyamī<br />yasyāṁ jāgrati bhūtāni sā niśā paśyato muneḥ"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā: 2.69)"},{"class":"b43","text":" But on the other side, we think that in the name of concrete reality they are running after phantasmagoria—just the opposite. They are running after the mortal achievements. They think immortality is not possible, and Socrates had to pay a heavy price for expressing that the soul is immortal. At the cost of his life, he announced that the soul is immortal. They objected, “No, nothing is immortal; therefore, it is foolish to neglect the mortal pleasures, so let us enjoy whatever there may be.” That was their viewpoint."},{"class":"b44","text":" The normal viewpoint is that we want to be wakeful in that plane of life which is darkness to them.

Our Guru Mahārāj, Prabhupād Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur, was the Āchārya of the whole Gauḍīya Maṭh and he was of such nature.

It is continual existence under the holy protection of the divine feet of Kṛṣṇa: to maintain one’s life of continuous engagement with all sorts of activities, while thinking, “The guide is upon my head. The divine feet of Kṛṣṇa are upon my head.” With this attitude we can easily remove what is foreign within us in no time at all. The continual remembrance of Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, of Kṛṣṇa’s connection, will in no time disperse all the difficulties along the way, as well as all meanness and all that is not dignified. Our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said, “The Gauḍīya Maṭh stands for the dignity of the human race.” We are to understand that slavery to Kṛṣṇa is a most dignified position. And everything against that ideal is meanness. The only standard of life for a gentleman is to understand and accept the position of subordination to the Absolute Truth. To admit what is proper and real, and on that basis make one’s life advanced, is not meanness. To understand one’s proper position and to understand one’s proper duty and discharge it—that is a gentleman’s life; to accept what is truth. What is considered to be meanness will be removed very soon.

Similarly, the Āchārya may show himself to have a young body but later in life he shows an old body. Similarly, in one birth he may come in a particular body and another time he may come in another body. The same Āchārya may come differently at different times. From the external we shall have to go to the internal. This applies to ourselves also. If I lose this body of flesh and blood and have instead only a subtle body, then I shall see the Guru in the form of his subtle body, not in the form of this physical type of body. The Devatās, Gandharvas, and Siddhas also have their Gurus, but neither they nor their Āchāryas have a material body.
