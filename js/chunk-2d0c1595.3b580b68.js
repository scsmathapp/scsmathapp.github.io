Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj between 1981 and 1985. Known affectionately to his disciples simply as Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, His Divine Grace personified the life of eternality, supramundane knowledge, and divine happiness, and he planted the nectar-seeds of Kṛṣṇa-prema—the supreme goal of life—in the hearts of the fortunate souls. He extinguished the burning fire of separation we felt in our hearts following the disappearance from this world of the great ambassador of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the West, His Divine Grace Śrīla A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Prabhupād, simultaneously fulfilling our cherished desires for spiritual nourishment and inspiring within us an ever greater thirst for spiritual perfection."},{"class":"b44","text":" The topics presented here have been selected to illustrate the proper and practical way for a sincere sādhaka (aspirant) to progress on the path of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, especially in His form as Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj repeatedly emphasised that the path should be followed carefully, step by step, without omitting anything, lest one fall into the traps of either sahajiyāism (imitationism) or māyāvād (impersonalism). He taught that by always keeping sādhu-saṅga (association of good devotees)—either personally or through their śikṣā (instructions), by chanting the Holy Names of the Lord with sincerity and faith, and by rendering loving service to Śrī Guru and the Vaiṣṇavas, one could steadily progress on the path back to Godhead."},{"class":"b44","text":" This progress continues and accelerates by our acceptance of ever higher conceptions and elimination of lower ones, and such progress is infinite, going beyond the taṭastha region of Virajā (nirvāṇa), the goal of the Buddhists, the brahma-jyoti, the goal of the yogīs, and onward through Śivaloka to the spiritual abodes of Vaikuṇṭha, Ayodhyā, Dvārakā, Mathurā, and finally Goloka Vṛndāvan. There, the Supreme is worshipped as Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Govinda in Vraja Dhām or as Their combined form as Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu in Nabadwīp Dhām, and it is by Their own grace that one may ultimately attain the inconceivably high position of service to the servants of the servants of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇi Herself, which is the ultimate goal of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas."},{"class":"b44","text":" Preliminary instructions regarding the process for controlling the mind and senses and the principles of devotional behaviour have been given in books such as <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Upadeśāmṛta</span> by Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī, and carefully following this advice in a properly-adjusted way will ensure genuine progress on the path of bhakti. Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj spoke at length on all these topics, but he always emphasised that it is one’s sincere internal hankering for the Lord’s service and the genuine feeling of one’s own incapacity which are the real keys to realising śaraṇāgati, the pure soul’s surrender."},{"class":"b44","text":" Ultimately, when genuine divine love awakens within the soul, that love will itself direct the soul to his or her best serving location within a particular serving group (<span class=\\"e3\\">svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</span>) imbued with one of the predominant serving mellows of either servitorship (dāsya), friendship (sakhya), guardianship (vātsalya), or the all-inclusive mellow of amorous love (madhura-rasa). Śrīla Guru Mahārāj explained that within these rasas there are divisions and subdivisions, heads of groups and their followers, right-wing and left-wing parties—so much gradation, all of which is ultimately arranged by the Supreme Lord’s own yogamāyā potency to provide a dynamic interplay of ‘variety-in-oneness’ by which the Lord’s Pastimes (līlā) are supported, nurtured, and enhanced."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Infinite is not static (nirviśeṣ) but dynamic, and that dynamism generates sweetness in service through both union and separation. Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s explanations of these finer points and his revelations of the inner meaning of the ślokas of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> and the gāyatrī and other mantras give such new dimensions of depth to one’s consciousness and nourishment to one’s devotional creeper (bhakti-latā) that they are impossible for the truly fortunate souls to ignore."},{"class":"b44","text":" The devotees who were introduced to the teachings of pure devotional theism by the unparalleled preceptor and śaktyāveś-avatār Śrīla A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Prabhupād will find in this book a very sweet and glorious illumination of his teachings. The ‘matchless gift’ of Kṛṣṇa consciousness which Śrīla Prabhupād gave to the West must be carefully accepted in the heart and preserved and nurtured there. That is only possible by the supporting strength of the devotional illumination given by great beacon lights of the spiritual world such as Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, whom Śrīla Prabhupād loved and revered as his own Śikṣā-guru in spiritual matters. The fortunate and awakened soul must see the value of this spiritual interchange as a cause of growth if he is to really progress towards the all-harmonising Truth beyond all material sectarian concerns."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is also my heartfelt feeling that the legacy of both Śrīla Prabhupād and Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj is being carefully preserved, practised, and preached by Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s successor, Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Mahārāj, and that in the unbearable fire of separation from those two great souls, our hearts may be given hope once again."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Lord mercifully comes as the Āchārya to deliver Himself to the souls of this world.

It is not that matter has produced consciousness, but it is in one part of consciousness. Consciousness is infinite, and everything is in that ocean. Somewhere there is ice, somewhere moss, somewhere iron—they are all in that ocean, these different conceptions. But consciousness is all-in-all, and everything has its shelter there. Just as you find patches of clouds in the sky or so many specks of dust in the air, so the material conception is there in the sky of consciousness. It is a sky—the conscious sky—and somewhere there are patches of clouds or dust. You can’t see the air, but the dust is in the air! You can’t see the sky—the actual ether—but the clouds are in the sky! So, the background is consciousness, and therein we find somewhere is dust, somewhere is a cloud."},{"class":"b69","text":" Darwin and others have proposed that consciousness was originally generated from material elements, but my response to that is, “Fossil fatherism? Crush it and establish a spiritual infinite!” It is all spiritual. The ‘fossil conception’ is a part of so many conceptions in the spiritual plane. Consciousness is in the background, and there are developed positions, gradations, within consciousness—Bhū, Bhuva, Sva, Maha, Jana, Tapa, Satya, Brahmaloka—and when service is added, it is enhanced. A sweet structure begins from the point when service is added to consciousness. Service can construct a beautiful capital, a beautiful country. It is there, and you have only to feel it, enter, and take up your appointed service. You will think, “This is my home! This appointment feels very friendly to me. Now I have come home.” This is the innate capacity or substance, innate nature—svarūp—which is presently covered by ignorance, by misconception."},{"class":"b70","text":" Madness and malengagement"},{"class":"b71","text":" A madman, leaving his own sweet home, wanders in the street and thinks that it is imperative for him to collect pieces of paper or cloth, as if that were his ‘business’. It is absurd. His brain is focussed in such a direction that he thinks, “It is my duty to collect these pieces of paper and pebbles.” In this way he is going on, but what is the real, innate wealth of his heart? If he could only remember his home: his father, mother, other family members—his sweet, sweet home. But due to his madness, his consciousness is forcibly focussed on some malengagement. Similarly, the position of so many persons—including philosophers, scientists, political leaders, and many more—is that their consciousness is focussed toward the external direction, and there they are all busy ‘collecting’. Some are collecting more pebbles, some more pieces of cloth or pieces of paper, but in this way they are going on. Swāmī Mahārāj (Śrīla A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Prabhupād) said that, “The United Nations, UNESCO—all such world committees and barking dogs are both equal. Actually, they are more dangerous because they are capturing the more intellectually-minded people, but they are of the same value. They are casting their own attention toward the material substance based on illusion and misconception, and posing in a very grand way, they are giving so much importance to that thing just as many dogs also bark to have possession of a particular thing. It is not more than that.” With great courage, Swāmī Mahārāj boldly refuted them, and this sort of conception is leading us to our higher prospect."},{"class":"b70","text":" Seeing beyond the perception of the senses"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Devotee:</span> Now the weather is starting to become hot!"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj:</span> We should not pay much attention to that.

It comes to mean matter or the world of material comfort. There are so many different views of the world. An ordinary man’s estimation of the world and a scientist’s estimation are different. An astronomer’s estimation of the world is of another type, the politician’s view is something else, the socialist’s, the humanist’s, the humanitarian’s views—they are all different. But if we can come to the plane of the soul—even the lowest conception of what is the real inner self—that will help us, and there will be a revolutionary change in our lives. All the things of this world will then seem to be trash, of no value, empty."},{"class":"b69","text":" Presently, the soul is captivated by a great many things which produce mean consciousness, but the solution is given in <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> how we can achieve control of our senses and gain control over the impulses of our mind. It is recommended there that step by step we try to rise up to the soul’s plane, eliminating the lower planes: first the field of experience of the senses; then the mental field, the impulse which works through the senses; then the intellect, that which drives the mental tendency; and crossing those, that we try to find that point of light which is the soul. If in any way, by the soul’s introspection you can perceive the soul, then whatever value you had assigned to this whole material manifestation will turn into ashes. You will see, “My real identification is here within! It is so wonderful, and valuable, and independent of all the hallucinations I was suffering from by coming in contact with the external world. The inner domain is so high, and my consciousness was focussed so low, on such nasty things.” That is the highest way to control one’s senses, one’s charm for the world, for wealth, women, and popularity."},{"class":"b70","text":" The astonishing soul"},{"class":"b50","text":" Kanak, kāminī, and pratiṣṭhā—collection of energy for sense pleasure, sense pleasure, and popularity seeking—these three things try to keep us down from consciousness of the self.

That point of light is near and dear, and the others are like foreign agents who have come to capture me and focus me, that light, towards the rubbish and dung-like things of this world. If after having been focussed here through our senses we become more attentive and see some nasty things, then some realisation will come into our mind causing us to feel that such things are actually foreign to our real self, and only by connecting with them through our senses do we feel disturbed. On the whole, it is like that. Then, upon rising up from the sense-plane, you will find that there is another wonderful land of experience; the ātmā is such a wonderful thing."},{"class":"b59","text":" āścharyavat paśyati kaśchid enam<br />āścharyavad vadati tathaiva chānyaḥ<br />āścharyavach chainam anyaḥ śṛṇoti<br />śrutvāpy enaṁ veda na chaiva kaśchit"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā: 2.29)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “Some see the soul as astonishing, some describe him as astonishing, and some hear of him as astonishing while others, even after hearing about him, cannot understand him at all.”"},{"class":"b69","text":" Even after giving attention to all these things, still it is very difficult to understand the soul properly. But our inner wealth is so valuable, and our present engagement is so nasty. On the whole, we must honestly admit that our condition is nasty.

But somehow we must get out of the intoxication of these nasty things, because to hanker after and obtain and mix closely with and relish these nasty things is improper for the soul. Whereas upon rising up to the Supersoul area, we find that the greatest fulfilment of our life is in that soil. Whatever we presently consider to be ‘concrete things’, to be real, are nasty.

The title of ‘lord’ comes from up to down, but in that case, it went from down to up! The grandson was first given the recognition of lord, and then the father, and then the grandfather. The grandson received the title first by dint of his capacity. So, it may be that because of previous arrangements, a less qualified person may give a push to a more qualified person in the beginning, and in return the more qualified person may later help him.

So, some allowances are given. For a particular type of disciple, there will be a corresponding Guru and a similar śāstra, but it is with the hope that they will take up the path of progress.

The sādhus and śāstras are going to the extremity of the sinful area because otherwise there would be no chance for anyone to rise from that level.

No. There is another aspect, and if that is analysed, ultimately we will see the order of the Lord. It is His order that Ganges water will purify. So, the purifying power comes from His will; His will is backing that.

She is the one who is full of Kṛṣṇa to the greatest degree, so Dās Goswamī says, “I want Rādhārāṇī.” Kṛṣṇa is there, and in different relative positions He comes to each particular person as sweet, sweeter, sweetest.

Adhokṣaja cannot be harmonised within our intellect. It is achintya-bhedābheda, inconceivably and simultaneously one and different. Both explanations may be true simultaneously. It is achintya, inconceivable. The Āchāryas have explained that when Baladev is performing Rāsa-līlā, He is actually conducting Rāsa for Kṛṣṇa in His heart. Externally, Baladev is seen to be participating in Pastimes with the gopīs directly, but internally He is making Kṛṣṇa enjoy that Rāsa.

The trees and creepers, the sands, and so many animals and birds are there, but still there is a qualitative difference between them. Uddhava, the highest devotee in Dvārakā, aspires to take birth as a creeper in Vṛndāvan. So, there are qualitative differences within śānta-rasa. In Dvārakā also, there is śānta-rasa, but he who has the highest type of sakhya-rasa in Dvārakā aspires after the śānta-rasa service in Vṛndāvan once he has gotten a little peep into the atmosphere of the type of service rendered there.

Leave his body.” Sāvitrī said, “Yes, you may take him.” Yamarāj took Satyavān’s soul, but then he saw that Sāvitrī, by dint of her penances, was closely following him in pursuance of her husband. Yamarāj said, “Oh, why are you coming? I am taking him. You must go back.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Sāvitrī replied, “No, I can’t.

I told you that you would have one hundred sons.” She replied, “If you are taking my husband, then how can I get any sons?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, Yamarāj was perplexed: “Yes, that’s true. What can I do?” So, he appealed to the higher force. Sāvitrī’s boon was sanctioned, and she got her husband back. Yamarāj had already committed himself—“You will get a hundred sons”—so Sāvitrī asserted, “You have clearly sanctioned that I will get a hundred sons; therefore, you certainly can’t take my husband!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The general idea is that if we get some backing from the higher sphere, that will overrule all mandates imposed by the plane of mortality. If we are given a place in Goloka, we cannot be detained in this mundane world. When Tulasī Devī can give us a place there, then why should we waste our prayer to her by asking, “Please clear away the dirt on which I am standing”? That is self-deception. So, we shall always pray to the higher servitors for the higher service of the Lord. We won’t care about where we might be; that problem will automatically be solved. If we get some higher appointment in the divine realm, then automatically we can’t be detained here. Therefore, a śuddha bhakta, a pure devotee, from the core of his heart will never pray for anything else, for that would be a waste of energy. Only, “Pure inclination toward the service of my eternal Lord—that I want. I know nothing else but that, and I do not want anything else.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" A pure devotee won’t pray for anything but for the higher service of the Lord of his heart. He can’t even imagine asking for anything for his or her own interest. In Christianity, such self-sacrifice is also present. And greater than that is self-forgetfulness. The self is there, but the servitor is forgetful of that and is cent-per-cent absorbed in attending to the pleasure of the Lord. No self-interest, wholesale self-forgetfulness—they are unconscious of their own particular interest because it has become merged in the interest of the Lord, the Absolute Whole."},{"class":"b52","text":" So, one who is aspiring to become a pure devotee should never desire anything else but to purely serve and give joy to the Lord of his heart. When one is unconscious of everything else—“Let it be, whatever He may like”—that is pure devotion for Tulasī, or whomever we are praying to. If one has got that higher sukṛti, that śuddha-bhakti, the seed of prema-bhakti, then he won’t be able to think of anything else but Kṛṣṇa’s pleasure. He’ll think only of the pleasure of his Lord, cent per cent, forgetting his own body, mind—everything. That is the purest type of prayer."}]},{"title":"Test, Taste, and Triumph","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b58","text":" Chapter Four"},{"class":"b47","text":" Test, Taste, and Triumph"},{"class":"b43","text":" According to one’s sukṛti, inner adaptability, and grace from above, the soul within will experience awakenment, emerge with some taste, and according to that taste, he will adjust himself with the environment.

This is tasteful, very, very tasteful.” According to his taste, he will take some particular type of ‘food’. Just as when animals are let loose, they will take food according to their own choice, so the awakened soul will be able to select a proper environment for himself. His inner taste will guide him: “This is very charming; this is attracting my heart. I feel helpless—I can’t control myself. So much attraction do I feel for this particular thing.” In that way, he will be guided. Intuition will direct him. In this world, we find intuition, and in the plane of divine life also there is intuition—the undiscovered tendency in the self—and that will perform the function of selection, elimination, and new acceptance.

Why have you left them to bring yourself here, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness? For what have you come, taking such risk?

The Guru is outside and inside. When we cannot catch the dictation of the inner dictator Guru, then we must have some guidance from the Mahānta-guru outside and from scripture.

The Buddhists may not care for the directions of the Purāṇas, but the Śaṅkar school and the Vaiṣṇava schools accept sannyās. Śaṅkar was a sannyāsī, and for the most part his successors were all sannyāsīs as well.

In Tretā-yuga, life may be maintained by the nervous system, but it is stated that in Kali-yuga, <span class=\\"e3\\">kalāv annagatāḥ prāṇāḥ</span>: one’s longevity depends on food.

All penances have been especially adjusted for Kali-yuga, and the only continuous fast allowed in Kali-yuga is for twenty-four hours, not more than that. In other ages, at least twelve days fasting was generally done. If a person had done anything wrong, then according to the smṛti śāstra, twelve days fasting was the standard punishment for any sins.

That has been interpreted as karma-sannyās, but still, sannyās is of several kinds. There is also vidvat-sannyās, which is considered by the salvationist section to be the highest. Their idea is that when one has fully realised that his connection with this material realm is a negative one, he will finish his material encasement and enter into the spiritual sphere. When he is fully established in this firm consciousness that “my connection with the material world will be injurious to me”, he will then relinquish his body and go away to the spiritual sky.

He does not immediately relinquish his body, but he takes whatever food he gets, and when he does not get any food, he fasts, and in this way he goes on. He leaves the household for good.

But tridaṇḍa-sannyās is when the sannyāsī engages himself fully in the service of Godhead by spreading His messages and doing some good to the public, and that characteristic is different. It is categorically different. The tridaṇḍi-sannyāsī is not adopting an attitude or tactic of leaving all of the engagements of this world as a result of becoming disgusted with its many temptations. Rather, he is engaging himself in the higher duty of the upper world through an agent, so his body has got utility. Remaining here, maintaining connection here, he is drawing some higher thing from above and distributing that in the environment. That is another conception of sannyās, and it has positive value."},{"class":"b69","text":" This is a similar engagement to that performed by the Lord’s closest associates. When an incarnation of God comes down, His favourite pārṣadas, His friends and servitors, are also sent by Him to come down to do some service to help Him. There are also sub-agents who have received some engagement from the higher agent, and by moving within this world in that capacity, they can earn more spiritual wealth than those who are very eager to disconnect completely from this material plane. They want to try to utilise their connection with this mundane plane to earn some substantial wealth of the upper house.

The mother will not touch the Deity of Nārāyaṇ, but her son who is worshipping Nārāyaṇ is touching her feet and taking her feet-dust. Such a position is there in the varṇāśram system.

They belong to the same section, and in them the qualities of sacrifice and submission are very clearly visible, so they should be respected. They should be respected, and the aggressive male nature is to be viewed unfavourably.

Gradually, that perception developed from inside, and ultimately I found that when the female nature is pure and in connection with the supreme līlā of vātsalya-rasa and madhura-rasa, it holds the highest position in the topmost realm.
