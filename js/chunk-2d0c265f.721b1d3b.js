Several disciples of Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj had approached him in 1979 and 1980 for his connection, but for that reason he did not accept them as initiated disciples. Still, he became saddened with the circumstances of their plight. It was then that his dearmost disciple and long-time confidant, Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj, urged Śrīla Guru Mahārāj to reconsider giving his divine connection to those who approached. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj desired to help, but he feared he would not be staying much longer in this world to give them the necessary direct guidance. This seemingly impossible dilemma set the stage for the most wondrous and fortunate sacrifice to have ever been witnessed in our lifetimes. Feeling Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s pain and understanding the dire need of the devotees approaching Śrīla Guru Mahārāj for his connection, Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj made a proposal to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. The substance of that proposal was staggering to the most imaginative minds: if Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would give his connection to those devotees, then Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj would accept the responsibility for their spiritual lives after Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s departure from this worldly plane. It was then that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj reversed his policy and began giving initiations to the Western devotees. Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj’s promise warmed the heart of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, and his acceptance of disciples from the West was similar to, and indeed reminded us, of the great campaign of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu some 500 years ago.

Yet somehow, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj accepted us—such was his magnanimity. And, moreover, this was only due to the great mercy of Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj. So, in what category can we posit his mercy?"},{"class":"b44","text":" From 1982 to 1986, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj preached to the entire world, without, to use Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj’s words, ‘world itinerancy’, and, according to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s own divine plan, Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj took sannyās in November of 1985. So it was that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, at Gaura Pūrṇimā in 1986, told the world of his decision to depart this worldly plane and reiterated his wish of the last forty years to leave everything in the hands of his dearmost disciple, Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj. No doubt we were saddened to hear the news of his impending departure. But the inevitability of it had been before us for several years as Śrīla Guru Mahārāj increasingly revealed the symptoms of failing health. Yet, we had the hope of a small child thinking that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would remain in this earthly plane throughout our lives. Such was the love he cultivated in us and such was our unfathomable attachment to His Divine Grace. All the more remarkable was this feat when we consider that he only performed this service by, and for, the mercy of Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj came to the West and created such a great following, it occurred to us (after his departure) that he came only to take us to the lotus feet of Sad-guru, his Śikṣā-guru, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Now, shortly after the departure of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, it is becoming increasingly apparent that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s great preaching and canvassing campaign to create a ‘relief agency’ for the fallen souls of the Western world, was to recruit us solely for the service of Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj, who would carry out the wishes of the paramparā perfectly. Such is the way of the very high Vaiṣṇavas, and we have been ever so fortunate to witness that. This was Śrī Guru and His Divine Grace, and it was our great fortune to be recruited to fulfil that. A few days before the Gaura Pūrṇimā celebration of 1986, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj delivered the following ordinance to all the devotional community present and, indeed, for his disciples near and far throughout the whole world:"},{"class":"b67","text":" “According to the desire of my Divine Master, I have been maintaining this disciplic succession, but it is no longer possible for me, as I am now too old and invalid. You all know that from long ago I have chosen Śrīmān Bhakti Sundar Govinda Mahārāj, and I have given him sannyās. All my Vaiṣṇava godbrothers are very affectionate towards him, and it is also their desire to give him this position. I have previously given to him the charge of the Maṭh, and now I am giving him the full responsibility of giving Hari-nām, dīkṣā, sannyās, etc., as an Āchārya of this Maṭh on behalf of myself."},{"class":"b89","text":" “Those who have any regard for me should give this respect and position to Govinda Mahārāj as my successor. As much as you have faith in my sincerity, then with all sincerity I believe that he has got the capacity of rendering service in this way. With this, I transfer these beads, and from now, he will initiate on my behalf as ṛtvik. The ṛtvik system is already involved both here and also in the foreign land. The ṛtvik is the representative. So, if you want to take from me, and you take by his hands, then it will be as well and as good as taking from me."},{"class":"b89","text":" “In the Mahāmaṇḍal, Sāgar Mahārāj and many others are also ṛtvik of Swāmī Mahārāj and also myself. They may do so, but in this Maṭh and in any Maṭh under this Maṭh, he will be the representative. If anyone cannot accept this, he may leave the Maṭh rather than stay here and disturb the peace of the Maṭh. With all my sincerity and good feelings to Guru-Gaurāṅga, to the Vaiṣṇavas and the Āchāryas, Mahāprabhu, Pañcha Tattva, Rādhā-Govinda, and Their pārṣads, with all my sincere prayers to Them, henceforth he will represent me in this affair beginning from today’s function."},{"class":"b90","text":" “Now I shall go from here, and he will do the necessary. On my behalf, he will give Hari-nām, dīkṣā, sannyās, and everything.”"},{"class":"b50","text":" Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj agreed to accept the responsibility of the Western disciples of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj in 1981, out of his intense desire to serve Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. As Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s disciple, he could empathise with the yearning of the Western devotees for Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s connection. In this way, both Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj were helping each other to serve the Divine Mission of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj further explained at informal gatherings during Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s Vyāsa Pūjā celebration in 1988 in Nabadwip Dhām:"},{"class":"b88","text":" “Śrīla Guru Mahārāj called Purī Mahārāj and requested him, ‘You arrange everything for Govinda Mahārāj’s sannyās.’ And after that function was performed, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was somewhat satisfied. Then on the 2nd of December 1985, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj registered his last will. He became very satisfied after that with this work—his transcendental work. Of course, we were praying, very selfishly perhaps, that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj must stay with us, but I came to understand that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj has his own desire and his own life also, and we cannot disturb that. One time when I voiced the sentiment that he stay with us, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj very quickly turned away his head from me. That time, it came very heavily to my heart that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj wants his own association, the Pastimes of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. He is that Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī coming in the form of Guru Mahārāj in this world, and he now wants to go there, but we are disturbing him. Then I thought either today or tomorrow or someday—any day we must face the inevitable separation. This situation of separation will come and then, what to do? If Śrīla Guru Mahārāj wants, immediately he can leave. And he did that."},{"class":"b89","text":" “But afterwards when we took Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s divine form downstairs, I could see that his body was so bright, and no disturbance was in his body. So from upstairs to downstairs, I was steady. And since that time, I have not come back up here until today (to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s room). This is the first time since Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s departure (on 12 August 1988) and it is for duty to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Only I am coming now to give the initiation for the devotees. Now we are bound to do our duty. Sometimes Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would say, ‘The transcendental duty is our life—there is no other life.’"},{"class":"b89","text":" “So, duty we must do, but there are two kinds of duty: mundane duty and transcendental duty. Sometimes mundane duty is attracting us, but we can transform that duty also in a transcendental way. Narottam Dās Ṭhākur also said in one song, <span class=\\"e3\\">gṛhe vā vanete thāke</span>, that we can stay in gṛhastha life, or sannyās life, or brahmachārī life—any life, if we can chant the mahāmantra and worship Mahāprabhu. Then, everything is going in that direction. No problem. At the time of Śrīman Mahāprabhu, most of His devotees were also gṛhasthas—Śrīvās Paṇḍit was a gṛhastha of the Pañcha Tattva, and Advaita Prabhu showed gṛhastha life. Nityānanda Prabhu lastly also showed gṛhastha life. In Kali-yuga, sannyās life is not recommended, not favoured for the devotional attitude. But tridaṇḍa sannyās is accepted in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>—not karma-sannyās, but bhakta-sannyās, that is another type of sannyās. It has its root exclusively in Guru-sevā—nothing else. No other thing. This way, there is some promise in Vaiṣṇava-sannyās: by kāya, body; mana, mind; vākya, speech; everything I shall engage in the service of Guru–Vaiṣṇava. That is the sannyās for this age. That sannyās is possible everywhere, and everyone can take it."},{"class":"b90","text":" “Formally, in our Vedic śāstra, there is brahmachārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, and sannyās; that sannyās is daiva-varṇāśram-dharma.

That śāstric sannyās is daiva-varṇāśram, and that is also accepted by <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> and certainly other śāstras.

Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s arrival, his Pastimes, and his departure were all miraculous and transcendental. Those who wish to fault any of his Pastimes as mundane, incoherent, or foolhardy do themselves the greatest harm. But they are certainly not the first to underestimate the divine instructions of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj."},{"class":"b52","text":" In 1981 when I visited a number of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s godbrothers on his order (to undertake a comparative study), I was often told by those well-meaning godbrothers, “Yes, but Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj is now too old and invalid”, as if to say “Your Guru Mahārāj is no longer preaching in this world at large.” But we can see that after 1981, from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s informal talks alone, several books have already come tat are lauded the world over. In addition, he closely supervised our printing and translation of his most revered writings, <span class=\\"e3\\">The Hidden Treasure of the Sweet Absolute</span> and <span class=\\"e3\\">Positive and Progressive Immortality</span>. Certainly now, no one thinks we were following an ‘invalid’. So also, the entire life span of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was filled with integrity and intent of purpose. He did not decide on his successor at the time of his departure: forty years earlier he had decided that Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj would succeed him, and at the end of his life, as we have quoted herein, he has firmly and resolutely reasserted his wish for our benefit. The elixir of nectar which has been carried to us from Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh for the last fifty years is still flowing by the mercy of Śrī Guru and Śrī Gauranga Mahāprabhu represented in the person of Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj. I take the feet dust of that elixir on my head and pray that the good sense to continue to do so never leaves me. The nectar has now become doubly sweet with the advent of Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Mahārāj. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj—acclaimed by one and all as the “maker of Gurus”—has presented us with his most precious gem in the personage of Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj.

Just now I was doing other duties, but when you engaged me in this service of speaking to you I thought, “Oh, this is also my service, but I have not carried it out.” In this way I am very thankful to you all because you want to engage me in my Divine Master’s service."},{"class":"b44","text":" In earlier days my Divine Master was sitting in this chair and distributing his mercy to devotees all over the world. Devotees were coming from so far. Some came 10,000 miles, some 6,000 miles, and some 3,000 miles. Sometimes when Guru Mahārāj was feeling sick he would say, “I am not feeling well; I cannot speak now.” At that time my tendency was to be very affectionate to my godbrothers, and I would request him, “Mahārāj, please speak a little, at least for only five or ten minutes. They have come from so far away. Please speak for five minutes, or even without speaking anything, just be seated there for five minutes.” In this way I requested him for my godbrothers. And Guru Mahārāj always agreed to my request. Even if he was not feeling well, he still would come to speak something for the devotees’ benefit. But when he was sitting in this chair, he was like another man—not a sick man. He would speak about Kṛṣṇa consciousness with full energy and full enthusiasm. I know, and Guru Mahārāj knew, that sometimes he wanted to avoid the meeting, but that was not sufficient for me. Once seated in his chair he was the worldwide Mission’s Āchārya speaking, and I would be surprised that often he would speak for two hours. In this way with much difficulty Guru Mahārāj tried to distribute the Kṛṣṇa conception, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, to the devotees."},{"class":"b44","text":" There are two kinds of devotees we can see in the world: those with a preaching tendency and those with bhajan tendency. One is called goṣṭhyānandī and the other bhajanānandī. He who wants to conceal himself and chant for his own benefit, who is doing bhajan, is called bhajanānandī. In the time of Prabhupād Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī there were two or three devotees who were like that. One you know very well: his name is Kṛṣṇa Dās Bābājī Mahārāj. Kṛṣṇa Dās Bābājī Mahārāj was a very close friend of Guru Mahārāj. He was a graduate, and learned, but he did not want to preach, he always wanted to do some bhajan for himself. He was in the mood of one who is self-satisfied—ātmārāma—one who tastes ecstasy himself, but does not distribute it to others. But Prabhupād Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī was not happy with this mood."},{"class":"b44","text":" At that time Guru Mahārāj was preaching in Northern India: Delhi, Kurukṣetra, Āmbālā, and other places. In the winter season it is very hard to preach there with snow falling and the well-water freezing. Once I heard from Guru Mahārāj that one night he was in Āmbālā railway station with Bon Mahārāj. They had no place to sleep, so they tried to sleep under the footbridge, but ice was falling down, and it was not possible to sleep. Guru Mahārāj had only one blanket and was thinking he may die because it was so cold, but he thought, “If I die, it will be for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, for my Guru Mahārāj, then I have no problem.” That night two men died. They also had no shelter, but they could not tolerate the cold. In this way Guru Mahārāj was preaching in Northern India. When he came near Benares, he wrote a letter to Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād telling of Kṛṣṇa Dās Bābājī Mahārāj’s affection for him. At that time Kṛṣṇa Dās Bābājī Mahārāj’s name was Svadikānanda Brahmachārī."},{"class":"b44","text":" He wrote, “Svadikānanda Brahmachārī is staying in Balihati. If you order me, I shall try to bring him for preaching.” Prabhupād Saraswatī Ṭhākur was very happy with that letter and immediately replied saying, “If you can bring him with you and engage him in preaching, then I must say that you are his real friend.” And there he mentioned: “Seated in the jungle of Balihati chanting on beads is not Kṛṣṇānuśīlana, real cultivation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The real practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is to preach to others and to practise oneself, by chanting ‘Hare Kṛṣṇa’ and doing Guru–Vaiṣṇava-sevā.

One who is very expert may see Paramātmā at a particular moment, but still, after that he must come back to his previous consciousness.

There is no fault-counting, therefore no problem comes to the real devotee. He is not doing anything for himself, he is not eating for himself, he is not sleeping for himself—he is not doing anything for himself.

When he was a child, a young brahmachārī, he went by horse and cart to preach with some sannyāsīs. At that time Prabhupād had two horse-drawn carts and one motor car. Big sannyāsīs and expert devotees were going by car for preaching. The middle-class devotees were going for preaching by horse and cart, and others were going by tram, bus, and other means. That brahmachārī was going by horse and cart with some sannyāsīs. Another sannyāsī was watching. Although a prominent disciple and qualified man, that sannyāsī did not have so much exclusive devotion to Śrīla Prabhupād. He said, “I am very unfortunate; I cannot understand my Divine Master properly. My Divine Master is preaching and demonstrating practical paramahaṁsa-dharma, but I cannot understand this.” Paramahaṁsa-dharma is the way of practising Kṛṣṇa consciousness with all one’s energy, activity—everything."},{"class":"b44","text":" A haṁsa takes milk from water. <span class=\\"e3\\">Haṁsa</span> means swan.

Madhura-rasa is inside Him, and He is as though mad, thinking, “What shall I do?” And Kṛṣṇa is seeing that Rādhārāṇī is getting all the ecstasy from His transcendental form and by His service. What Kṛṣṇa wants, She immediately presents Him with that. She knows what Kṛṣṇa wants, and She is always preparing for Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa has no chance to serve that Mahāśakti, Rādhārāṇī. By the service of Kṛṣṇa, Rādhārāṇī gets everything, but Kṛṣṇa does not get that, even though He enthusiastically wants it most. So He thinks, “It is only possible if I Myself assume the position of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, then I shall be able to taste that ecstasy She is feeling.” In this way Kṛṣṇa took the bhāva and kānti—the mood and colour—from Rādhārāṇī and He became Gaura Mahāprabhu; and that is the very highest entity that we worship with utmost reverence."},{"class":"b44","text":" Now our position is very low, but from below, downstairs, we are expecting that by the mercy of Nityānanda Prabhu we must get a lift, an elevator to go there.

We are observing their associates now living in this world: they are present in this world, and we are hearing from them and trying to practise Kṛṣṇa consciousness as much as possible. We are trying to a lesser or greater degree; still, no doubt, our attempt is lacking. It is always necessary to have more and more attachment with consciousness—full Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everything is consciousness, but it is necessary to engage ourselves fully with that Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Many, many births have gone before, and maybe many are waiting in the future.

I know that you are both super-servitors of Lord Kṛṣṇa, but I am your servitor’s servitor; I have some duty.” If their Master’s table is dirty, will the Master clean that? No! If the Master will want to clean it, the devotee must give objection, “Please give me that opportunity; it is my duty, not yours.” In this way the devotees have some ego: they must serve their Master. “Please do not interfere here, but go and be seated over there, and I shall worship your lotus feet.” This is the meaning that is coming through this śloka."},{"class":"b44","text":" In that assembly there were great, great paṇḍits, including Śrī Rām Gopāl Vidyābhūṣaṇ, who was a very great devotee of Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād and a great Sanskrit scholar.

The jīva-soul in his clean position always worships his beloved lover, that is, Kṛṣṇa, and that is the only duty he thinks of. The natural duty in the transcendental service world is love. The transcendental world is full of love. Kṛṣṇa is infinitely loving. He gives love infinitely, but by giving His love to one, He is not reduced thereby so that He would not then be able to give His love to others. Mostly all the jīvas are going there to that plane of the transcendental life of love, but unfortunately a few souls come here to this world. In this mundane plane they are always searching for love, but here pure love is not to be found. There is the plane of renunciation, the plane of dedication, and the plane of exploitation.

Therefore it is not possible to experience such things in this mundane plane without connection with the transcendental world. In this world we are living with only the shadow of that loving sense and with the identification of male and female. Sometimes we are trying our best together, and with each other, to get that essence. And sometimes for the non-disturbance of this mundane plane we are living together with some system for sympathetically dealing with nature and our hankering for real love. But by our activity here we are going in a circular way, again and again dying and taking birth. We are taking so many different types of birth in different forms of life, and we are searching, “Where is love? Where is love?” like a blind fellow searching for the light of the world of dedication. We cannot see where that world of dedication is, but our supreme lover, Kṛṣṇa, can see everything.

He replied that they are worshipping Her, but under the impression that Rādhārāṇī is under the guidance of Kṛṣṇa, whereas we have the clear conception from Śrī Nitāi-Gaurāṅga which is quite the opposite."},{"class":"b69","text":" You should both regularly read Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s books and sincerely follow his guidance and advice. Everything is nicely presented by him in a short, conclusive, and sweet way. By focusing our energy only there, it will bring the highest transcendental fruit."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> There seems to be a very fine line between reality and illusion. Everywhere I look I see a forest fire of self-interest. I feel we need some solid, tangible guidelines and encouragement to align us with the current of the Gaudiya sampradāya."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj</span> replied:"},{"class":"b43","text":" What Śrīla Guru Mahārāj has given to the world is living and is with the highest prospect of fulfilment. He has glorified and distributed pure Vaikuṇṭha-nām. By following the path of pure chanting with service-mood, gradually we can connect with the Lord’s figure and colour, His qualities, then His associates and paraphernalia, and then His Pastimes. We can be given the chance to enter there and be given some duty if we may be blessed by Him with some engagement. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj is in front of us and is guiding us in this line. With firm faith, simply we are to follow the process that he is continually describing to us. With this real spiritual connection the path must take us to where we are welcome as a willing servitor. In the highest position all labour is a labour of love, and there is no weariness, indifference, or hate there. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj has given such bright promise of that land, and that has drawn the fortunate souls throughout the whole world to his lotus feet."},{"class":"b69","text":" The prospect is great, but no doubt these are difficult times for all the devotees now that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj has disappeared from our immediate vision. It is a time of test, but Śrīla Guru Mahārāj himself gave assurance that those who are victorious in standing by the ideal even after the disappearance of their Guru, will be glorified and successful in spiritual life."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> I received connection with Śrīla Guru Mahārāj by ṛtvik initiation, but my ṛtvik Guru has now fallen down. Like others I feel badly deceived. I am writing to you directly seeking your advice and shelter. Can you please tell me whether my existing dīkṣā initiation by that ṛtvik Guru is still valid under these circumstances? What should I do?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj</span> replied:"},{"class":"b71","text":" I am not aware of the exact circumstances of your own initiation, but I can clarify what is the situation for devotees who may have received connection to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj through the ṛtvik process. That is, when a person holds a post as an officer in the government, he may himself be given duties to appoint others in certain ways and to make all types of arrangements. If he should leave or be ousted from that officer’s post, then naturally his authority as a government representative is also finished. However, whatever arrangements he had made and whoever he had appointed during the time of his holding office; all this will still stand and will be recognised by the government as before. But when that officer goes, then those that were being engaged by him may ask, “Now what is my duty?” For Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s devotees that duty is to serve his central Maṭh and Deities, and this is what Śrīla Guru Mahārāj advised to everyone after their taking initiation. Engage in this central service, chant ‘Hare Kṛṣṇa’, and preach Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s conception, and if anyone will find any difficulty, then he will ask the chief secretary."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> What should we think when chanting japa?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj</span> replied:"},{"class":"b71","text":" I asked Śrīla Guru Mahārāj what we should focus our attention on while chanting japa, whether on the Deity form of Kṛṣṇa, or something else. His reply was that we are only to concentrate on avoiding the ten offences and four types of Nāmābhās. Everything is in the pure Name chanted under the guidance of Gurudev, so if we can chant purely, without offence, then everything will be revealed. We are not yogīs, jñānīs, tapasvīs, and so on; we are active devotees aspiring after the pure ideal of our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> For two years now I have been intrigued by astrology. I am enclosing my birth chart and asking if you can give some advice?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj</span> replied:"},{"class":"b43","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and Śrīla Prabhupād Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur were both great jyotiṣīs, knowers of astrology, but few people know that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was a great jyotiṣī. By the order of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj I also studied astrology in order to get some understanding, but I am not practising that. I looked a little at your chart, but I do not know the Western type of astrology, only something of the Eastern system."},{"class":"b69","text":" Although Śrīla Guru Mahārāj knew astrology well, he did not practise it. Rather he gave enthusiasm for chanting, reading devotional books, service, and so on, and if we can unquestionably follow that line, it will be best for our future."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> My wife is not a devotee, and sometimes she gives opposition to my practising life. How can I overcome this problem? Also Śrīla Gurudev, I wish to ask some further questions: i) Can you tell me about my past lives, as I have been asked this by colleagues at work? ii) Is ‘Prabhu’ used only to address initiated disciples? And, iii) may we read <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj</span> replied:"},{"class":"b43","text":" When Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj first started his Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in the West, in America, at that time he tolerated many things for the sake of the fallen souls. Even he could not take the food to which he was accustomed, but gradually everything came nicely under his control. In this way we must tolerate everything and know that if it is Kṛṣṇa’s will, it will therefore come gradually to the set-right position. With the proper transcendental vision we can always and everywhere receive enthusiasm to do the sevā of our Divine Master."},{"class":"b51","text":" Regarding your first question, Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur in his <span class=\\"e3\\">Śaraṇāgati</span> sang:"},{"class":"b93","text":" pūrva itihāsa,<span class=\\"e10\\">\\tbhulinu sakala<br /></span><span class=\\"e11\\">\\tsevā-sukha peye mane<br /></span>āmi ta’ tomāra,<span class=\\"e10\\">\\ttumi ta’ āmāra,<br /></span><span class=\\"e11\\">\\tki kāja apara dhane</span>"},{"class":"b43","text":" The meaning is that the Vaiṣṇava does not care to remember or think about his past lives.

Some of the sections of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> are very helpful for the devotees, but that also must be read within the association of the Vaiṣṇavas.

They have also chanted your glories, and I am writing to you for your mercy."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj</span> replied:"},{"class":"b71","text":" It is true that we are most fortunate to have come across the shelter of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, and the association of their devotees. Vaiṣṇava-saṅga is giving us the highest opportunity to serve Śrī Śrī Guru Gaurāṅga Gāndharvā Govindasundar, as we can directly connect with them (the Vaiṣṇavas). Like the telescopic system we must send our service through Guru-Vaiṣṇava. Service is our life, and in the association of the Vaiṣṇavas we must get everything. You please try to read the books of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, especially <span class=\\"e3\\">The Loving Search for the Lost Servant</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Sermons of the Guardian of Devotion</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Prapanna-jīvanāmṛtam</span>, and others.

Please offer me some advice on this matter."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj</span> replied:"},{"class":"b43","text":" Regarding your questions: for householders, what is a suitable dress for their duties, they may accept that. For their preaching, what is most suitable may be worn, but at least for ārati, for the worshipping of the Deities, the dhotī, and so on, should be worn. The brahmachārīs will more actively maintain the external garments. They are full-time representing the Mission and should be recognised as such, as far as possible. But for sannyāsīs they are to always wear the dress of sannyās. If it is absolutely necessary for them to wear shirt, pants, and so on, at any time, then under those garments their sannyās cloth will be worn. The only time for them not to wear their sannyās garments is in a grave life-or-death situation."},{"class":"b44","text":" The thread must always be worn. The kaṇṭhī-mālā (neck-beads) must also be worn but, if necessary, a single thread may be worn at the least. These general guidelines you can follow. We want to favourably present Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, and what is suitable for that we will accept according to the circumstances."},{"class":"b69","text":" In every sampradāya and every religion there must be some who will misrepresent the teachings or give a bad impression to the public, but that should not hamper our own mission. Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād would always establish the super-excellence of the pure Gaudiya–Vaiṣṇava conception, and he would march onwards strongly despite so much heavy opposition. In this way he established the dignity of this Mission."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> I am a householder, and I have one room which is reserved solely for worshipping the Lord and bhajan. My request is: what form should that worship take, and in what way can I improve my sādhana?"},{"class":"b71","text":" Sometimes I hear devotees criticising other devotees, and I feel I must run away and hide so as not to lose respect for them.

Sometimes they may analyse others and learn from them, but not in the mood of criticism. Also it is practically to be noted that sat-saṅga, real sādhu-saṅga, is very rare in this world. When great personalities like Śrīpād Swāmī Mahārāj and Śrīla Guru Mahārāj will point out others’ practice of religion, then that is not criticism, but it is only for the benefit of their associates and followers that they are to beware of such things."},{"class":"b52","text":" I am trying to answer your questions, but no doubt it may not be possible to cover everything in a letter. Anyhow, with the guidance of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj given in his books, lectures, and so on, and with sincerity of purpose in following them, the proper adjustment to each circumstance will come. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj himself always stressed that we are all students, not masters, so we are always learning how to serve and what is service.

So we can understand the importance of this message for such as ourselves."},{"class":"b55","text":" Not only our body, but our faith and devotional creeper must also be looked after. If our faith is once broken, it may not be possible to fully repair it again. Therefore if any black spot can be seen in another that may injure our own faith, then we must be careful to avoid that from afar. With great humility and respect for everyone we must try to always engage in topics and service connected with Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Guru."},{"class":"b55","text":" The jñānīs and yogīs are going to much trouble, and with great austerities they are constantly rounding the universe searching for a hole in the cover in order to go out. But the devotees simply surrender to the Lord and His devotees and in that way accept His divine will and protection. They qualify to enter far beyond the plane of the material universes."},{"class":"b43","text":" This mundane world is the very distrustful area of māyā. The demoniac asura mentality has always given trouble to the devotees ever since the beginning of the conscious world, but the devotees are taking everything in the light of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They see that all is coming by the will of Kṛṣṇa, and so their spiritual benefit is behind everything."},{"class":"b52","text":" Bilvamaṅgal was blind, but Kṛṣṇa was playing with him by slapping his hand. When Bilvamaṅgal tried to catch Him, Kṛṣṇa hid Himself.

For example, many explanations have been given of the gāyatrī mantram by the Āchāryas, but Śrīla Guru Mahārāj broke the hard fort around that mantram and revealed the internal meaning. Already <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> has given the meaning of the gāyatrī, but that is in 18,000 ślokas. I asked Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, “The gāyatrī is a hidden treasure, but you are distributing that by including it in the English commentary of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhagavad-gita</span>.
