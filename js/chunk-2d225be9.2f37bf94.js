Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj requires little introduction. Disciple of the great pioneer of the teachings of pure devotional theism in the present age, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur Prabhupād (1874-1937), Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj was named by his Gurudev as the ‘guardian of devotion’, and his life and teachings—his immense scriptural knowledge, oral and written contributions, and depth of realisation—have touched innumerable hearts of godbrothers and disciples alike."},{"class":"b44","text":" Following the departure from the world of his beloved godbrother, Śrīla A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Prabhupād (1896-1977), the great ambassador of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the Western world, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s very presence in the world brought new life, light, and hope to many of Śrīla Swāmī Prabhupād’s disciples. Though Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj himself disappeared from mortal vision in 1988, after having appointed his most beloved disciple Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj as his successor, that presence continues to shine brightly both in the hearts of his disciples, grand-disciples, and followers all over the world, and at his place of bhajan (worship), the beautiful Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh at Nabadwīp."},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Awakening to the Absolute</span> is an extract from a talk which was delivered in 1982 during the first months of that year when devotees, seeking guidance and nourishment for their spiritual lives amidst turbulent times, were visiting Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj at Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh. Actually, we had known about this wonderful gem for a long time and had intended to publish it much earlier but were unable to locate the tape recording. During a visit to Norway in 1997, a video film of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj was being shown in one devotees’ home, and lo! We were blessed. Subsequently, we were given an audio copy of the same from which the present offering was transcribed."},{"class":"b44","text":" Previously, two booklets also containing excerpts from Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s talks, entitled <span class=\\"e3\\">Home Comfort</span> and <span class=\\"e3\\">Inner Fulfilment</span>, were published. Although intended as introductions to the spiritual life of devotion and suitable for public distribution, these also contained conceptions of much greater depth and were in fact of great value and much loved by practising devotees all over the world."},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Awakening to the Absolute</span> may perhaps be seen as completing this trilogy of booklets. Herein is shown how the Absolute Truth in its fully revealed aspect is Kṛṣṇa, and therefore Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the summum bonum of all spiritual search. Taking the basic theme of those previous books—the search innate in every living being for fulfilment which can be finally realised in the human form—the development of this search in a progressively specified form, blessing the soul with greater and greater fulfilment in the life of divine service, is shown."},{"class":"b44","text":" Though it is certainly true that sincere faith (śraddhā) is the first and foremost qualification—or pre-qualification—and necessity for the spiritual aspirant, it is incorrect to assume that spiritual life is somehow haphazard or unscientific. By authentic spiritual practice under expert guidance and with the help of divine grace, the goal is realised by stages; awakenment of the soul is such. The Lord Himself (<span class=\\"e3\\">Bg</span>: 10.32) says, “Of all kinds of wisdom, of all sciences, I am the spiritual science of the self—the knowledge of the soul.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" However, with this science, the results are not, cannot be, verifiable in the empirical sense because here the work—the experiment if you will—is performed not on, or with, any external apparatus, but on and with the experimenter himself. The results, therefore, are necessarily subjectively (in the subject, self) realised. That is why, to the uninitiated, religious experience always seems an impenetrable mystery. Indeed, Śrī Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna (<span class=\\"e3\\">Bg</span>: 2.69):"},{"class":"b67","text":" “While spiritual awareness is like night for the living beings enchanted by the material phenomena, the self-realised soul remains awake, directly relishing the divine ecstasy of his uninterrupted spiritual intelligence.

We have made adjustments only where unavoidably necessary to show the meanings in the text as clearly and accurately as possible, (especially) for the reader unfamiliar with Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s particular spiritually-charged, charming, and poetic manner of speech."},{"class":"b44","text":" At the end of the book, we have also included some verses on chanting the Holy Name, the yuga-dharma or recommended means for spiritual realisation in the present age. The subject matter of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s talk is so essential, in fact, that we were surprised that the talk had not been brought out earlier in the original excellent publications explaining the Kṛṣṇa conception, as produced by Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s disciples in the early 1980’s. But then, there is such a wealth of material available (it has been estimated that the recorded informal discourses over nearly nine years [1979-1988] would fill 80 books!), and of course, it is a great fortune that by that arrangement, our humble self might be given the chance to do this service."},{"class":"b44","text":" Without further ado then, we happily present His Divine Grace’s talk.

And we have to get help from the sādhus who have got Kṛṣṇa consciousness within them just as from one candle another candle may be lit. A candle cannot produce light from within, but it is to be lit from another candle. It is something like that. We are to awaken our buried Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is covered by anyābhilāṣ, karma, and jñān (fruit-seeking, selfish work, the result of the attempt to satisfy material desires, both fleeting and ‘organised’, and the search for philosophical/spiritual knowledge, devoid or independent of devotional service). So, that light, that association, will come to help the sleeping Kṛṣṇa consciousness within us, and our consciousness will arise from its sleep and show itself as it is. So, the method is that: to take sādhu-saṅga. <span class=\\"e3\\">Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-janma-mūla haya ‘sādhu-saṅga’</span>: association with the sādhu, devotee of Kṛṣṇa, is the root cause of Kṛṣṇa consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" At the same time, it is told that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is ahaitukī, causeless.

The satisfaction is produced in our heart; we can feel it. <span class=\\"e3\\">Ahaituky apratihatā</span>: it has no cause, and it cannot be checked, cannot be opposed; opposition cannot have any effect there. It is such. Bhakti comes from bhakti. In this way, it is ahaitukī just as the light is there and another candle is lit from it. From light, light is coming. In this way, we are to trace it out, to understand it. The original light, that is eternal, self-existent, and is extending itself, so it has no cause; it is causeless. The cause is there eternally, and it is extending itself."},{"class":"b70","text":" Connection with the causal plane"},{"class":"b71","text":" And, bhakti is apratihatā.

The negative meaning is: you will have no attraction for ‘non-God’, that is, you will have no mundane attachment, no attraction for mundane necessity. And positive: <span class=\\"e3\\">viśiṣyate-rāga,</span> you will have excellent (viśiṣyate) attachment (rāga)—that kind of attachment which is accepted through the process of selection and elimination, attachment located in its proper place. Your attraction (to Him, to God) will not be through a raw or approximate estimation: “This is good; that is bad; this is a mixture”, but you will have progressively eliminative attraction, adjusted attraction. This is the meaning of <span class=\\"e3\\">virāga-yuktam</span>. So, this knowledge is such, <span class=\\"e3\\">jñānañ cha vijñāna-virāga-yuktam</span>: knowledge that is supported by (based on) attraction and also, by experience of the system, that knows how much attachment—more attachment or less—is necessary in any part of it.

Wherever and how much attention is necessary—the criterion is according to that. So, the head is more important, and the leg a little less. In this way, you will gradually acquire properly adjusted attachment for the systematic whole. First it is hazy, a mass of attraction, and then the attraction will be systematised.

His heart is fully awakened, and at the same time he sees that the environment and the object of his search is also fully equipped. This is full-fledged theism."},{"class":"b44","text":" Full-fledged theism is where the theistic conviction receives its satisfaction in the fullest way. Just as with the opening of the eye, we can see the world, and according to the degree of our sight, we come to see the subtlest thing of the environment, so also by our inner awakenment of the fullest type, we come to a particular world, environment, and that is Vṛndāvan—Goloka Vṛndāvan, the land of love. And movement there is spontaneous, and all around we find the environment only friendly. It is so simple, so friendly, and the dealing of all who are there are filled with so much intimacy."},{"class":"b69","text":" And in Vṛndāvan we will find that our thirst for any higher change of environment, of association, no longer needs to be quenched, but there is thirst, eternal thirst, for coming in closer relation with them, closer connection with them. There is no possibility of any higher change of environment—where he has reached is almost final—and now the only remaining thing is how to come into a more and more close connection with the environment. And that becomes the initiative of our movement there: more and more intimate connection with the environment. The environment is eternal, but in the intimacy of connection, the ‘competition’ (in loving service), the movement, is there. And the guidance is given according to that."},{"class":"b70","text":" Merging in Kṛṣṇa consciousness"},{"class":"b43","text":" In this way, there is progress, there is some sort of necessity by which the service is moving. And, there is repetition, a kind of repetition, but it is ever-fresh, ever-new! It is ever-new, and it is only a question of the time. For example, every day when I am hungry in the morning, food is tasteful to me, and not always. By the movement of the time, it is like that. In this way, everything is palatable, not stale. In that plane, there is movement of time, but it is eternal. It is managed by yogamāyā (the internal potency of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who arranges and conducts His līlā) in such a way."},{"class":"b44","text":" And finally, there we will attain the fullest satisfaction of all the inner parts of our system, the wholesale satisfaction of every atom of every constituent part of our spiritual body. <span class=\\"e3\\">Prati aṅga lāge kā̐de prati aṅga mora</span>: every part of my every limb cries for union with the corresponding part of every limb of the other side. Sambandha, relationship with the environment, may come to such a stage that every atom constituting my spiritual body and mind will aspire after union with every corresponding part of the environment. In this way, in such a friendly way, so many are moving there, and it is adjusted accordingly by yogamāyā. And this is the highest conception."},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Prati aṅga lāge kā̐de prati aṅga mora</span>: every atom of my existence is in loving aspiration with the environment, and that is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa consciousness has surrounded me. ‘Surrounded me’ means from all sides it has embraced me. I am lost in the thought of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, with its detailed, elaborate acquaintance. I am merged, merged in the deepest part of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, where I shall find that Kṛṣṇa has captured every atom of my existence. Every atom is feeling as if it is experiencing separate pleasure by His embracing."},{"class":"b44","text":" This is possible only in the consorthood relationship, where every atom has been embraced, captured, by coming into the most intimate connection with Him. It is called ādi-rasa or mukhya-rasa. The name of madhura-rasa is ādi-rasa, that is, it is the most original. It is the source of all other rasas, and all other rasas are dependent on it. So, it is called ādi-rasa. And, mukhya-rasa: the sum total of all rasas, their gist, their essence, is represented there. We are told like that."},{"class":"b69","text":" And Mahāprabhu came with this gift—madhura-rasa. It is <span class=\\"e3\\">anarpita charīm chirāt</span>: that which was never distributed before—that of which it is considered any distribution was not possible previously before Him."},{"class":"b70","text":" Highest revelation"},{"class":"b71","text":" In Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur’s book <span class=\\"e3\\">Jaiva-dharma</span>, we find that one Vaiṣṇava is asking his Gurudev, “Devotion, it is eternal, but why do you say that it came from Mahāprabhu?” Then, his Guru, Paramahaṁsa Bābājī, is saying, “I visited Vṛndāvan and asked the eternal servitor of Śrī Chaitanyadev, Sanātan Goswāmī: ‘This <span class=\\"e3\\">anarpita charīṁ chirāt</span>—which has never been dealt with before—what is the meaning underlying it?’ Then, Sanātan Goswāmī replied, ‘Bhakti is eternal. In <span class=\\"e3\\">Nārada-bhakti-sūtra</span>, <span class=\\"e3\\">Śāṇḍilya-sūtra</span>, all such scriptures, this has been given, but the type of devotion which Mahāprabhu came with, which we meet after the advent of Mahāprabhu Śrī Chaitanyadev, that was not previously at any time open to the ordinary person. So, it is called <span class=\\"e3\\">anarpita charīṁ</span>. And what is that standard of devotion? It is this: complete surrender to Kṛṣṇa in consorthood, where every atom of the jīva-soul gets welcomed and embraced by the corresponding atom of Kṛṣṇa consciousness—madhura-rasa. That was not open to the public before. This is my finding, my faith. You may accept or not accept.’ Sanātan Goswāmī told like this to that Vaiṣṇava: ‘This is my private conception—you may take it, or not.’” This was his reply."},{"class":"b70","text":" The world of dedication"},{"class":"b43","text":" So, devotion has its beginning. The beginning of devotional life is here, where Kṛṣṇa says, <span class=\\"e3\\">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti</span> (<span class=\\"e3\\">Bg</span>: 7.19): “I, Vāsudev, am the source and substance of all that be.” Then, the beginning of bhakti, the primary admission into the devotional school above jñān, knowledge, and vairāgya, renunciation, that is śānta-rasa (passive relationship with the Lord). And from there the gradation: dāsya-rasa (servitude), then sakhya-rasa (fraternity), then vātsalya-rasa (parenthood), then madhura-rasa (conjugal). All this is given in details in Rāmānanda-saṁvād."},{"class":"b52","text":" In this way, bhakti is going up. Systematically, we are to understand and digest, digest what is bhakti.
