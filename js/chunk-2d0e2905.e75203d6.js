Scholars of India and the world over have acclaimed Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s holy talks for their undisputed authenticity, saintly simplicity, and charm. His masterful ability to bring ever-new illumination to the world through his most elevated spiritual insight is the joy of the sincere devotees and genuine theistic scholars. This smaller treatise contains five of His Grace’s informal talks with the devotees hitherto unpublished, and I am confident that it will be received with great spiritual joy by both the new entrants to the divine life as well as the veterans. The work was made possible by the untiring efforts of Śrīpād Hari Charaṇ Brahmachārī Sevā Ketan Prabhu and Śrīpād Mahānanda Dās Brahmachārī Prabhu, to whom my unceasing gratitude is due.

He serves Me, and he also is worthy of the same reverence and worship as I am. He is My part and parcel, a member of my family, and my family is the purest of the pure. All of My family are agents of purity and are distributing purity to the world.” Purity is not only self-abnegation, but the higher purity is in self-surrender. That service is not calculative nor with any motive, but it is automatic, spontaneous service: service of the beautiful, service of love divine. It is not the service of power but it is service of beauty, love. Satyam, śivam, sundaram. Sundaram is the most original factor ever discovered in this world. So, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu and <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> preached about sundaram, which is not mere unassailable eternal existence to be adored, and not mere consciousness of the material substance which may be discovered as a wonderful thing to be adored, but sundaram is the fulfilment of the consciousness. The real existence of that highest substance was given exclusively by <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> and then by Śrī Chaitanyadev and His followers. We are worshippers of the beautiful. Reality the beautiful, reality the love, reality the harmony. That is the highest quarter of the existence, and we are connected internally with that. So, we must aspire after that scientifically. There is a particular method, and we are to follow that. The śāstra, the scripture, is there, and the living śāstra, the sādhu, the saint, is there, and under their guidance we can hope to attain the highest fulfilment of life. “Die to live.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" So many proposals in the name of helping are only helping us to incur debt in this world. Already one is under the pressure of a heavy burden, and again in the name of help he is securing a fresh loan. So, more burden is coming on his head. This is the nature of help in this world. No work can be fully pure in this world. It may be said that at least there is goodwill, but we say that goodwill is also impure and filthy. Everything is impure and rubbish here, but with the help of the scripture and the real agent, we are to come to know what is good and what is bad. Then, we are to accept the good and eliminate the bad. Previously, Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu came distributing this conception, and in the modern time our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād, came and almost singlehandedly began his fight against the so-called existing principle of help in the environment."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Vedas say, “In the garb of religion, so many materialistic things are being delivered. It is a treachery to the ordinary people.” We are to know what is pure religion, what is the real recommendation of the Vedas which has its conclusion in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>. The Veda is likened to a wish-fulfilling tree, kalpa-vṛkṣa: whatever we want, it can supply that. And from that has come naturally the ripe product, the ripe fruit of the Vedas, and that is <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>. There is no artificial colour there that any scholar can come and thrust his own interpretation into the <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> and say, “This is <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam’s</span> opinion.” <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> is not subject to the Vedas’ or the Upaniṣads’ opinions, but the <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> has come automatically from the Veda tree."},{"class":"b44","text":" One who cannot tolerate another’s position is a jealous person. This <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> is only meant for those that are free from jealousy so that they can understand that there is only one Principal who is all-in-all. He is autocrat, and He is all-in-all. He is our master, and He can make or mar. Only those who have no jealousy can come to such a level as to enquire about truth. Whereas, the jealous cannot admit that there is God and that the whole creation is designed and destined by Him. There is the land of the Lord, and if we can enter into that plane, then we can be really happy by giving and not by exerting. To sacrifice for Him will bring for us both quantity and, especially, quality. If we can have entrance into that plane, we shall be able to swim in the pool of nectar. It is very much appreciable."},{"class":"b44","text":" We can understand that it is very much appreciable, that so many from foreign lands have also come being attracted by the instructions and advice of Mahāprabhu and <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>. So many young people have been charmed by the beauty of the teachings of Śrī Chaitanyadev, <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, and their agents. That they would come to join us was already predicted by Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur some one hundred years ago, and our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj began the work in a humble way. After that, one of his disciples, Śrīpad A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj, went to the West empty-handed, but by the grace of Mahāprabhu, Kṛṣṇa, and Nityānanda Prabhu, he was very much successful to push this high level of advice to the West. Attracted by his earnest desire to distribute this nectar, the Westerners have come in the hundreds to join the saṅkīrtan party under the banner of the Gauḍīya Maṭh, Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur, and A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj. I am sure that you will be pleased at heart to find them amongst you here. They are taking all sorts of risks in their lives in order to preach these truths to the whole of the world with all the might and resources at their command. There are men of all different types who have joined this movement including bright scholars, doctors, and businessmen. They are taking this message to every corner of the earth most skillfully, and so we must feel and express our gratitude towards their divine attempt and to their earnestness to know and distribute this sort of high order of knowledge of relief to the people at large. We appreciate their presence here and their attempt, and I feel that you are all of the same opinion as myself that they have encouraged us in a very extraordinary way to search. Many Indians are encouraged by their presence. They are also very inquisitive, “What is there that so many foreigners of high grades are also coming to appreciate? There must be something to be enquired.” In this way, so many Indian persons who are holding high positions in the worldly educated society are also coming."},{"class":"b52","text":" So, we give our thanks to those noble persons for their attempts, and we pray to our Guru and Vaiṣṇavas that their attempts may be fulfilled by them."}]},{"title":"Praṇām Mantra","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b47","text":" Praṇām Mantra"},{"class":"b35","text":" to Om Viṣṇupād Aṣṭottara-śata-śrī <br />Śrīmad Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj"},{"class":"b60","text":" śrī-svarūpa-rāya-rūpa-jīva-bhāva-sambharaṁ<br />varṇa-dharma-nirviśeṣa-sarvaloka-nistaram<br />śrī-sarasvatī-priyañ cha bhakti-sundarāśrayaṁ<br />śrīdharaṁ namāmi bhakti-rakṣakaṁ jagad-gurum"},{"class":"b59","text":" sindhu-chandra-parvatendu-śāka-janma-līlanam<br />śuddha-dīpta-rāga-bhakti-gauravānuśīlanam<br />bindu-chandra-ratna-soma-śāka-lochanāntaram<br />śrīdharaṁ namāmi bhakti-rakṣakaṁ jagad-gurum"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Bhakti Sundar Govinda)"}]},{"title":"The Four Sittings of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b58","text":" Chapter One"},{"class":"b47","text":" The Four Sittings of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> In the beginning of <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, events are described of Sūta Goswāmī speaking at Naimiṣāraṇya and this is after Vyāsadev had spoken <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> to Śukadev. So, how is it that Vyāsadev was aware of the events at Naimiṣāraṇya?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj:</span> So many sittings of <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> took place. First, Nārad came and gave instruction by way of a ten śloka outline. He told Vyāsadev, “Meditate on it and give it out to the public. Elucidate these principles. Elucidate; otherwise, what you have given so far will be all fruitless.” So, Vyās took only those ten ślokas, those ten verses. He meditated and wrote the principal <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span> in a short way. He gave, “That is revered Brahma, the highest quarter, the Kṛṣṇa conception of Godhead, and that līlā is very sweet. That is nothing of this side in māyā, but that plane is full of transcendental, sweet Pastimes.” Vyāsadev managed to call his son, Śukadev, and in Badarik Ashram he taught him: “Although my inclination was towards this nondifferentiated Brahma conception, my father managed to teach me this līlā of Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa. Today, I shall talk about that to you in this great assembly.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" So, Śukadev received <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> from Vyāsadev. Previously, Nārad gave it to Vyāsadev, and Vyās composed it in elaboration and taught it to Śukadev; this was the second recitation. The third was when Śukadev delivered lectures with his remarks to the great assembly of scholars in Śukratāl."},{"class":"b51","text":" When Śukadev gave the lecture, there was one Sūta Goswāmī who was a very sharp hearing man, śruti-dhara. <span class=\\"e3\\">Śruti-dhara</span> is one who having only once heard something keeps it in his memory, and Sūta, having those qualities, was present in that meeting. The fourth sitting was in Naimiṣāraṇya where the ṛṣis, apprehending the black march of Kali-yuga, commenced and engaged themselves in a one-thousand-year campaign, yajñā. Finding Sūta Goswāmī, they told, “We have got much leisure in the evening to hear about the Absolute, and we heard that you, Sūta, were present in that mysterious and famous assembly where Śukadev gave his lecture about <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span>, and you memorised it. We request that you deliver by way of lecture to us that <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span>.” Sūta Goswāmī accepted their proposal, and that was the last sitting in the form of regular evening lectures. Sixty thousand or so ṛṣis, the scholars and performers of sacrifices, assembled to hear from him. It was after this sitting that Vyāsadev took the whole thing and compiled it in book form and let it loose on the public."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> What is that Śukratāl that you mentioned just now?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj:</span> Śukratāl is a small district of Uttar Pradesh just opposite Vibhukuti, a little far off from the Ganges, where there was the place of Mahārāj Parīkṣit. When Parīkṣit was sure to die, he came to live in that place near the Ganges, and there the third assembly took place. Perhaps it was from Śuka that the name Śukratāl has now come, and by that name this place is known to the public."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> Was Vyāsadev present at Naimiṣāraṇya when Sūta spoke?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj:</span> No, he was not present in the meeting, but he got information. He was a yogī. Vyāsadev was such a yogī that he could understand and feel whatever is happening anywhere. In this way, the whole battle story in <span class=\\"e3\\">Mahābhārata</span> has been described by him. How it is possible? Not only that but he was a yogī of such higher class that he could transfer his yoga-śakti to Sañjaya who, inspired by that potency, could also feel that battle. He could observe so many things simultaneously—what one is saying to another, what weapon one is throwing to another—all these things Sañjaya could see simultaneously, and he is relating the whole thing to Dhṛtarāṣṭra by the grace of Vyāsadev. Vyāsadev is able to see many things simultaneously in his yoga, developed consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" Once, one gentleman told me that Einstein in his last days was asked by his wife, “What invention are you searching now?” He replied, “If I am successful in this campaign of my research, then you will be able to see me wherever I am. Wherever I shall be, you shall be able to see and feel me. That plane I am going to try to invent.” That was Einstein’s last tendency according to one gentleman, though I don’t know how far it is true."},{"class":"b44","text":" Many devotees are also said to realise such a position that from a separate place they can detect when a dog is entering within a particular temple in Vṛndāvan. He is feeling, “Oh, a dog is entering there.” When our plane of consciousness, our conscious seat, is not disturbed by any self-produced thought, when it is clear, then when any wave carrying any news strikes it, it can feel that: “This is happening somewhere else, and the wave has come to touch the aerial of my consciousness.” When our conscious seat is very clear, any wave that arises to touch it, any fact that arises in our plane of thinking, that cannot but be an actual fact. But when self-produced prejudices have covered the conscious seat, then we cannot detect such things; the plane of our consciousness cannot be read. But when that is cleared, any incident happening anywhere sends some wave to every ‘receiver’, and each can understand, “Oh, such thing is happening!” Useless thoughts and false thoughts do not arise in his mind. Whatever is happening is sending some wave. His mind is so clear that he detects that event. He reads his mind, he feels it, and he says, “Oh, this is happening here and that is happening there.” It may be considered something like that."},{"class":"b51","text":" But this is a kind of siddhi, mystic power. A true Vaiṣṇava avoids all these things, but automatically it may come to someone, and sometimes they may disclose this fact. Otherwise, they avoid all these things. They do not want miracles. They are eager to find out the miracle of the centre, the central miracle. They are busy to search for the miracle of miracles, and so these side issues they neglect. They are all-attentive to find out the main problem. Their cent-per-cent energy is engaged for that, concentrated, without caring for these things."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, when Śukadev was asked to speak <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, he was in the presence of his Guru, Vyāsadev, and Param Guru, Nārad. So, how is it that he took the exalted seat of the vyāsāsan in the presence of his Guru and Param Guru?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj:</span> Śukadev was not asked to speak <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span>, only Parīkṣit Mahārāj prayed, “What should be the duty of a man who is surely going to die very soon? How should I utilise my energy that it may help me after death? Certain death is approaching towards me, and so how can I utilise my time best?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" So many ṛṣis, authorities of different departments, were recommending to him differently, and he was perplexed. He told, “You give some unanimous verdict to me. I have no time, so please you give some unanimous instruction.” At that time by chance, Śukadev arrived there at the meeting. Śukadev was a man of fable; many had heard about him, about this peculiar realised soul. “He is a boy of sixteen, but he has got no feeling about this world which is so charming to all of us. We are trying our hardest, our best, to get out of the entanglement of this charming world, but we find that we fail at every step. However, that boy, Śukadev, has crossed the line of māyā and always is in continuous conception of the conscious world. He is quite ignoring these material things, and he does not even find the necessity of a cloth around his waist. Even he has got no distinction in his mental eye as to whether one is a woman or a man. He is so highly and firmly established in pure spiritual conception that even the beautiful girls do not feel any necessity to cover the parts of their body.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He was like a fable to the gathered sages. So, when Śukadev appeared, they all rose in honour of him. Śukadev is not caring for anything there, and when he entered, all the ṛṣis told to Parīkṣit Mahārāj: “Mahārāj, you are very fortunate; this mahātmā, whom we all seek to have darśan of, has come. You please ask your question to him. We are all eager to hear something from his lips.” So, they all unanimously put Śukadev in the presidential chair. They all took their seats, and Parīkṣit asked him, “I am just approaching certain death, so what is my duty? How should my duty be couched in order that I can have my highest benefit in the least span of time?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śukadev began to answer, and everyone there in pin-drop silence began to listen to his words. His words were coming unquestionably as the Absolute Truth and were unanimously accepted by all. Present in that assembly were all the big scholars who had come to give some consolation to Parīkṣit Mahārāj: “You are such a good Mahārāj with good administration. You are unparalleled as well as a lover, respecter, and protector of the brahminical yajñā, faith, etc. Despite all these qualifications, you have been thrown a curse from that same side of the brāhmaṇ section, and that is a very lamentable thing.” In this way, almost all the leaders of all different schools of philosophy came to give consolation to Mahārāj Parīkṣit. It was in that well-represented assembly that Śukadev was to speak."},{"class":"b44","text":" Nārad and Vyāsadev knew well that, “What we are trying to inaugurate, which seemed to be a very narrow and bigoted thing, when Śukadev will speak this <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavatam</span>, he will give it in a very extensive way and with the widest colour.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Nārad expressed, “I gave ten poems as ten outlines to Vyāsadev, and he elaborately taught that to Śukadev. Śukadev has got some extensive credit and honour amongst all the types of scholars. Coming in that broad view and percolated by his Brahma conception, we are eager to see how this elaborated <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> shall be delivered to this world retaining its transcendental characteristic. In order to do away with any mundane misconception, it must pass through Śukadev; otherwise, people may think this to be mundane. He has got the broadest conception of view, and his qualification is admitted from all sides.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Nārad and Vyāsadev were present and eagerly waiting. Happily, they tasted how through Brahma-jñān, through the widest touch, this Kṛṣṇa-līlā, which seems to be of very limited and narrow things, passes through to be widely accepted. All these gentlemen for seven days attended this meeting, and they all listened with such eagerness."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śukadev told, “From my father, from my dear affectionate father, I have learned these things.” And giving warning to the audience he told, “You all know that I have no bigoted conception about religion."},{"class":"b44","text":" “The broadest conception of religion I possess, and I am famous for that. I have got contact with the Brahma. Brahma means the biggest, the greatest plane—the higher, widest plane. I am already settled in that consciousness, so what I say, don’t take it as mundane happenings of this limited world, but it is coming from the other side. That is beyond Brahmaloka and has attracted me. I have got no charm for anything of this mundane world. I am well established in the transcendental world. I shall give delivery to you all of what attracted me and what I have noted and studied, and that is fully transcendental. With this warning, I give delivery of all these things, of Kṛṣṇa-līlā. You should take it that Kṛṣṇa’s Pastimes are broader, wider, higher, and deeper things in the transcendental world. You must take it like that.” Now and again giving this warning, Śukadev is delivering the whole thing, and Nārad and Vyāsadev are reflecting: “Yes, we are successful!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" In his introduction to <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>, Vyāsadev has written there, “Originally this <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> is a very good thing, but still its beauty is enhanced by the commentary that has come from the mouth of Śukadev. The <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhāgavat</span> knowledge modified and ornamented by the knowledge of Śukadev has got a wider view, and that universal truth will be easy for all sections of the religious school to accept.”"},{"class":"b52","text":" So, knowingly, it was that the Guru and Param Guru of Śukadev were present there. They knew the future and could understand that this recitation would occur, and also out of sympathy for Mahārāj Parīkṣit, they came.

Śrīla Prabhupād further solidified this recognition upon hearing Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj’s Sanskrit composition <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī-Bhakti-vinoda-viraha-daśakam</span>, when he endorsed the holy poem as a direct inspiration of Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur."},{"class":"b69","text":" Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj took a prominent part in the founding, organising, and preaching of many of the Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭhs of Śrīla Prabhupād Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Goswāmī all over India. As a climax to his divine affection and blessings to Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, during the last days of Śrīla Prabhupād’s manifest Divine Pastimes in this world, he especially selected Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj to sing <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Rūpa-mañjarī-pada</span> for him, which is well known as the most venerated and adored prayer of the entire Gauḍīya sampradāya; by this action we can know Śrīla Prabhupād’s indomitable confidence in his ‘guardian of devotion’ as the future captain of the Śrī Rūpānuga sampradāya or divines succession of faithful followers of Śrī Chaitanyadev in the line of Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī. And who could doubt this? The nectarean river of Sanskrit and Bengali compositions that flowed from his pen stand as great monuments in the line of Śrī Chaitanyadev. In his latter years, some hundreds of disciples of the late world preacher Śrīla A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj flocked to Śrī Nabadwip Dhām to hear the holy informal talks and advices of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, and from tape-recordings of those talks many English publications reached to the Western public, scholars, and devotees. The wholehearted acceptance of his divine delivery and those transcendental works by the genuine devotees is irrevocable, not only by dint of Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Mahārāj’s openly avowed acceptance of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj as his Śikṣā-guru, but simply by the strength of their own spiritual merit. Therefore, great numbers of sincere seekers from all over the world also flocked to the lotus feet of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj to become surrendered disciples of the guardian of devotion."},{"class":"b70","text":" His Divine Servitor"},{"class":"b43","text":" Om Viṣṇupād Aṣṭottara-śata-śrī Śrīmad Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj made his appearance in this world on 17 December 1929, at Bamunpara, district Burdwan, only about six miles from Śrīpāṭ Hapaniya where his beloved Gurudev made his advent, also situated in the holy area of Gauḍa Maṇḍal. Revealing his Pastimes to the conditioned souls of this worldly plane, at the tender age of only seventeen years Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj manifest his coming to the lotus feet of his Gurudev Śrī Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj in April 1947 on the holy appearance day of Śrī Nṛsiṁhadev (Nṛsiṁha Chaturdaśī)."},{"class":"b44","text":" If any of the dear readers of this short account may have, or have had, the opportunity of hearing directly from other stalwart veteran disciples of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj (an opportunity the humble writer has fortunately had on many occasions), such as Śrīpād Bhakti Prasūn Araṇya Mahārāj, Śrīpād Hari Charaṇ Brahmachārī Sevā Ketan Prabhu, Śrīyuktā Kṛṣṇamayī Devī, Śrīyuktā Rāmārāṇī Devī, and Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s own revered brothers and disciples Śrīyukta Satyendra Chandra Bhaṭṭāchārya, Śrīyukta Amarendranāth Bhaṭṭāchārya and others—any fortunate soul will be able to trace the unbroken line of continuous unalloyed divine affection that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj bestowed upon Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj and continues to eternally bestow from his holy abode in the nitya-līlā (eternal Divine Pastimes)."},{"class":"b44","text":" On the Amāvasyā (dark-moon day) of 12 August 1988, when Śrīla Guru Mahārāj silently took his form of holy samādhi at his beloved place of bhajan, Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh, Nabadwīp Dhām, at that time all the devotees felt that the exalted moon had disappeared from their vision; yet, by his divine grace, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj had already foreseen the devotees’ need for uninterrupted light, for the smooth continuation of their devotional services; and therefore three years before he conferred the holy order of Tridaṇḍa-sannyās upon Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj, naming him as his illustrious successor, as the guiding light to perfectly ensure that no darkness could enter into his sampradāya (divine succession)."},{"class":"b44","text":" The illustrious Āchāryas or divine preceptors have often been described to be as brilliant as the sun.

They are the merciful bestowers of the very kernel of love divine for the Supreme Lord which is the absolute life of all that lives (<span class=\\"e3\\">divya-bhagavat-premṇo hi bīja-pradam</span>).

In every subsequent will he made, the last one being the fourth, his choice of his successor never changed. And even above and beyond the legal aspect of his choice, in the plane of transcendental service we find—again a fact confirmed by the above mentioned most revered faithful veteran devotees of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj—within only a matter of a few days after Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj’s initial approach to the lotus feet of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj in 1947, Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj remarked, “He will be my successor.” This is also a fact which was witnessed by many of the venerable veteran sannyāsī godbrothers of Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, all of whom held Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj in the highest transcendental regard without exception.
