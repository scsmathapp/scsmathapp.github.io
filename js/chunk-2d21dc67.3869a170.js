It is the land of love, sweetness, charm, and beauty—all are synonymous. It is heart-capturing. Our real existence is neither in our knowledge nor our power, but in our heart. Really, our proper identification is with our heart. So, in which direction our heart is moving, that is the all-important factor in our life. It is a heart transaction."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu recommended: “Don’t rely on your knowledge, reasoning capacity, or power, but the heart transaction is all-important in you. The inner factor of your existence is in your heart. So try to guide your heart towards sweetness—towards home. And your real home is not here where we are wandering around with no certainty throughout eight million four hundred thousand species according to our karma. But only in the human birth, with the help of the divine agent, can we go back to our home: to home and affection.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Home is there, where the environment will take care of us, our fortune, and our comfort, independent of our consideration. The affectionate paraphernalia there will help us very affectionately and lovingly. So we should make good use of this opportunity to go back to God, back to home, our sweet, sweet home."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu recommended the path: “With the help of the divine agent and the revealed scriptures, try to go there yourself. Your present position is uncertain. After death it is not fixed where you will be carried by the current of your previous karma, therefore try to utilise for the best whatever time is available before your death. You have free will, therefore those days before your death are to some degree in your hand to use, so that time you must utilise with the utmost care for God realisation.” There is nothing so important as this for all of us."},{"class":"b44","text":" The advice in common for us all is: “Give up all your duties and jump into the one duty, to go back home. There, everything is full and complete, and everyone will look after your real interest. So you must go there: back to God, back to home.” And Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu came here only for the purpose of telling us this: <span class=\\"e3\\">yāre dekha</span>,<span class=\\"e3\\"> tāre kaha ‘Kṛṣṇa’ upadeśa</span>, “Whoever you meet, talk to him about Kṛṣṇa, and both parties—the hearer and the speaker—will be benefitted. By this cultivation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, both parties will be benefitted permanently.” So, only in Kṛṣṇa consciousness will our time and energy be best utilised."},{"class":"b44","text":" Other things are superficial, but the serving spirit is the deepest part within us. That is the deepest transaction: a transaction with the environment in the deepest plane. And that serving spirit is divided into two. In the lower position it has some calculation, such as: “I must do this, I must not do that; for I need to attain so many things.” But in the highest section, there is no calculation based on any selfish transaction. There the sacrifice is so great and so complete—so perfect—and the servitors have such deep connection with the Absolute that they do not care for themselves in the least. Through love and sacrifice they come to have such a deep connection. Their transaction with the Absolute is all-affection, all-loving."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mahāprabhu Himself is the Absolute. He came as an Āchārya to preach about the highest destination of the jīva [the soul]. He disclosed that the highest attainment is the greatest sacrifice: we must ‘Die to live’. Our ego—our entire egoistic individuality—must die a wholesale death, and then we will find we are in such a place: in the family of God, the family of the Absolute. We shall be amongst our family members, and they are not guided by any law, but only by affection and love. Our highest fulfilment of life is achieved neither through attaining knowledge nor power, but through affection and love. No science and no power can achieve that."},{"class":"b44","text":" At present science is serving power. So many scholars are investigating and discovering so many things, but that scientific research is really subservient to power because it is trying to compete for the domination of this lower world of selfish sense satisfaction. But the fulfilment of our heart’s satisfaction is in the Kṛṣṇa conception of the Absolute. He is the Lord of love, beauty, ecstasy and happiness. That is the innermost necessity of us all. Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu said, “Go straight to Vṛndāvan by this special train. Don’t try to break your journey anywhere, for that will only be a loss of time and energy.” In addition He said, “Whoever you find, give them Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is just as in a famine-stricken country, whoever you will find you will give some food to save him, but this is a hundred times more urgent—so you are to inject Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Tell them, “A loving Lord is above your head seeing everything. You only have to connect with Him and His servants. His servants are very, very kind and magnanimous. Somehow get some connection with them, and try to go to your home. Here, nowhere is home. Your home is only there.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" For example, a madman may be wandering here and there, but if he is cured of his madness, he will go straight from the street to his home. He won’t continue to wander in the street endlessly like a vagabond but he will go straight home to both satisfy himself and also to satisfy his near and dear ones, his guardians."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, whoever you come in contact with, Mahāprabhu advises, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Yāre dekha</span>,<span class=\\"e3\\"> tāre kaha ‘Kṛṣṇa’ upadeśa</span>: whoever you find, you will have no other duty than to inject them with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That Kṛṣṇa consciousness will not only save everybody from all troubles but it will also give them their highest fulfilment of life. Take that up and do such service with all seriousness and earnestness.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Nityānanda Prabhu is the most magnanimous among the group who recruits. He is the head, the leader of all the generous recruiters, the most generous recruiting officer. We must try to have His mercy. A single drop of Nityānanda Prabhu’s mercy can help us wonderfully. Nityānanda Prabhu wanted to distribute Śrī Gaurāṅga to one and all. He approached every door, begging each person, “Take the Name of Gaurāṅga! Take the Name of Gaurāṅga! I shall be eternally indebted to you. If you only take the Name of Gaurāṅga once I shall be your slave—your eternal slave!” Appealing in such a way He would begin to cry and He would fall down and roll on their doorsteps."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Mahāprabhu took His permanent seat in Jagannāth Purī He sent Nityānanda Prabhu to preach: “I give You Gauḍa Deś [Bengal]. Without You, Nityānanda, no one will be able to help them. Look after them. I give you this role. Go to Bengal to help them, to deliver them and give them the fulfilment of life.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" Nityānanda Prabhu took up that responsibility, and here in Nabadwīp Dhām we are under His guidance. Nityānanda Prabhu is the leader of those preaching about Gaurāṅga; and for one who receives the grace of Gaurāṅga, automatically the Rādhā-Govinda-līlā, the Vṛndāvan-līlā, is his."},{"class":"b60","text":" yathā yathā gaura-padāravinde<br />vindeta bhaktiṁ kṛta puṇya-rāśiḥ<br />tathā tathotsarpati hṛdy akasmāt<br />rādhā padāmbhoja sudhāmburāśiḥ"},{"class":"b43","text":" Unknowingly, that līlā will come within your heart.

Please explain something of the early days here at the Maṭh and in particular, why Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh is considered to be such a special place."},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj:</span> After the disappearance of Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād, the Mission begun by him—Gauḍīya Maṭh—started to go in an unexpected way. Therefore many of the prominent personalities left. When Śrīla Guru Mahārāj came out from the Gauḍīya Maṭh, about fifty per cent of the senior devotees also left. Everyone in the Mission had much respect for Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Therefore when he left, they also left. Some of the devotees who withdrew from the Gauḍīya Maṭh at that time were: Hayagrīva Brahmachārī [Mādhav Mahārāj’s former name]; Goswāmī Mahārāj, who was in charge of preaching in the West; Keśav Mahārāj, who then was Vinod Bihārī Brahmachārī, the estate manager in charge of commanding Śrīla Prabhupād’s central Maṭh, Chaitanya Maṭh in Māyāpur; Narahari Prabhu, the advisory manager of Chaitanya Maṭh; Narasiṁha Mahārāj; Jājāvar Mahārāj; Vaikhānas Mahārāj, as well as many others."},{"class":"b44","text":" Most of the stalwarts left the Mission. Only three stayed: Niśikānta Sānnyāl; Bhakti Sudhākar Prabhu, he was a man of great personality; and Sundarānanda Vidyā Vinod, the editor and publisher of the <span class=\\"e3\\">Gauḍīya</span> magazine as well as of many of the books of the Gauḍīya Maṭh. By the mercy of Śrīla Prabhupād he did much sevā at that time."},{"class":"b44","text":" After the breakup of the Gauḍīya Maṭh Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was not very enthusiastic to preach. He did not want to make another mission, and therefore went alone to Vṛndāvan. The devotees then lost track of him, but all Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s godbrothers were very enthusiastic to take him preaching. They repeatedly searched in many places to try to locate him. Finally some godbrothers discovered Śrīla Guru Mahārāj in Nabadwīp. I have seen the place in which he stayed at that time: it was a single room opposite the Ganges. It has since been altered but not demolished."},{"class":"b44","text":" Word soon reached the other godbrothers and they came to take Śrīla Guru Mahārāj to preach. Again they tried to make another mission with the association of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Then Keśav Mahārāj, Goswāmī Mahārāj, and Narasiṁha Mahārāj all took sannyās. They were the first three sannyās disciples of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, and with them the Gauḍīya Vedānta Samiti was started at the Devānanda Gauḍīya Maṭh. But again some differences came between the devotees."},{"class":"b44","text":" It was Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s nature to stay alone, so when again some differences came, he gave everything to Keśav Mahārāj."},{"class":"b44","text":" Keśav Mahārāj was a great disciple of Śrīla Prabhupād. He took sannyās from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and wanted to preach and be a guru. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj established him as the head of the Devānanda Gauḍīya Maṭh, and under him the preaching programme continued."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj stayed alone and did not go out even to beg. Maṇi Bābu, his next younger brother, was a divisional superintendent in the Eastern Railway. Every month he gave ten rupees to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj with which he maintained himself, thus he did not go out to beg. He lived in a house named Mager Bāḍī near to what is now Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh, and he paid two rupees per month rent. That house has since been demolished."},{"class":"b44","text":" While staying at that Mager Bāḍī two godbrothers of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj were enthusiastic to stay with him. It later turned out that their thinking was that if they could help Śrīla Guru Mahārāj to start another mission, then in due course of time they would inherit it, but Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was very simple-hearted and could not understand their motive. He again engaged himself in preaching, but in a limited way, and on one occasion he engaged in Bhāgavat-pāṭh [lecturing on <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span>] for one month in the temple at the King of Manipur’s palace."},{"class":"b44","text":" At that time Sakhī Bābu, a godbrother of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, offered to buy Śrīla Guru Mahārāj some land. Sakhī Bābu was a great disciple of Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād who had done much service in Chaitanya Maṭh. He did many things for Śrīla Prabhupād including the building of the Yoga Pīṭh Mandir, and also the Bhakti Vijay Bhavan. He brought there electricity, a generator, and a road also."},{"class":"b44","text":" It was this Sakhī Bābu who told Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, “If you choose a piece of land I shall give the money to purchase it.” In this way for his bhajan ashram Śrīla Guru Mahārāj chose this land where Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh now stands. At first its area was one acre, stretching from the bamboo trees on one side, up to six feet behind Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s building on the other side, and up to my present house on this side. The south-western corner was marked by the small bathroom building, now in ruins."},{"class":"b44","text":" At the time when Śrīla Guru Mahārāj chose this land there were only a few trees: three mango trees, two guava trees, and the tree just to the north of my house here. One of the three original mango trees left at the same time as Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s disappearance."},{"class":"b44","text":" After the purchase of this land in 1941 Śrīla Guru Mahārāj made a thatched house, and on Ratha Yātrā of that year he entered into this Maṭh."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Gauḍīya Maṭh was founded by Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād, and later Jājāvar Mahārāj and other godbrothers of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj incorporated the word <span class=\\"e3\\">Gauḍīya</span> into the name of their Missions: Śyāmānanda Gauḍīya Maṭh, Devānanda Gauḍīya Maṭh, and so on. But Śrīla Guru Mahārāj thought in another way. Our sampradāya was actually started by Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu and it is running under His divine direction. Although we are Brahma–Mādhva–Gauḍīya sampradāya, the real conception of rāgānugā-bhakti was first shown by Mādhavendra Purī, the ‘Grand Guru’ of Śrī Chaitanyadev. There the conception was in seed form, but it manifest in the form of a tree in Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore, bearing in mind the main identification of our sampradāya, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj included the name of Śrī Chaitanya in the name of his Maṭh. The name of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s Guru is Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād, therefore to cover from beginning to end the identification of the whole sampradāya Śrīla Guru Mahārāj used the name Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh as the name of his Temple and Mission."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj personally chose and purchased a very long, strong, and costly bamboo pole from one Nārāyaṇ Ghosh who owned a large bamboo garden. On the very first day of his stay he hoisted a flag on that tall bamboo flagstaff on the spot where the Temple now stands."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Guru Mahārāj entered, his Deity was Giridhārī Jīu, who he had brought from Vṛndāvan. He chose this place for a number of reasons. One reason was that it is aparādha-bhañjan-pāṭ, Koladwīp: the place where all offences of those who surrender are vanquished. Another reason for establishing his Maṭh here was that, as well as being aparādha-bhañjan-pāṭ, this is Girirāj Govardhan, Gupta Govardhan [Hidden Govardhan Hill]."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād preached over the whole of India and he also tried to preach all over the world, but still he was not able to preach successfully in this area of Koladwīp. Here there were many great paṇḍits who heavily opposed Śrīla Prabhupād and his preaching programme, therefore Śrīla Guru Mahārāj wanted to convert that section."},{"class":"b44","text":" He started to preach to that party headed by Tripathanāth Paṇḍit. He was the head of the area of Tegharipara. Also there was another big paṇḍit famous throughout India; his name was Gopendu Sāṅkhyatīrtha."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj started to preach in the house of his aunt, Sarojavāsinī Devī. She was a very popular lady, and her name is also included on a plaque on the side of Mahāprabhu’s Temple here. She was very famous, and everybody respected her. When Śrīla Guru Mahārāj started preaching in her house many of the members of the opposing group also came to hear—and were converted by him."},{"class":"b44","text":" After Śrīla Guru Mahārāj first came here, some of his godbrothers joined him, showing themselves to be unconditionally surrendered. Presently also, other godbrothers joined with Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. These brahmachārīs joined at least a few months after Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s first coming here to Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh."},{"class":"b51","text":" Guru Mahārāj’s nature was always to compose something, and he composed many ślokas. When he started Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh he immediately composed the following śloka:"},{"class":"b60","text":" śrīmach-chaitanya-sārasvata-maṭha-vara udgītā-kīrtir jayaśrīṁ<br />bibhrat sambhāti gaṅga-taṭa-nikaṭa-navadvīpa-kolādri-rāje<br />yatra śrī-gaura-sārasvata-mata-niratā gaura-gāthā gṛṇanti<br />nityaṁ rūpānuga-śrī-kṛtamati-guru-gaurāṅga-rādhā-jitāśā"},{"class":"b50","text":" [In the holy abode of transcendental touchstone,<br />Śrī Nabadwīp Dhām—the selfsame Śrī Vṛndāvan,<br />in the land of Koladwīp, whose inner identity<br />is the king of mountains Śrī Govardhan,<br />near the charming shores of the holy River Bhāgīrathī<br />who delivers all the fallen souls<br />stands that grand and glorious king of all temples—<br />Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh."},{"class":"b50","text":" In that beautiful retreat, the surrendered devotees<br />whose lives are the message of Śrī Gaura,<br />are eternally absorbed in the loving service<br />of the Divine Master, the Golden Lord Gaurāṅga<br />and the loving Lord Śrī Govindasundar<br />with His consort Śrīmatī Gāndharvā,<br />accompanied by all Their beloved associates."},{"class":"b50","text":" With hearts always filled with good hope<br />to attain the grace of the Lord,<br />following faithfully in the Line<br />of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunāth—<br />the storekeepers of the unlimited treasure<br />of pure, sweet love divine,<br />those surrendered souls ever sing the unending glories<br />of the transcendental name and qualities<br />of the most magnanimous, original Supreme Lord<br />Śrī Śrī Gaurāṅgasundar."},{"class":"b50","text":" Indeed, the hearts of all beings, moving and still,<br />marvel in the glory of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh<br />as they take shelter in the soothing, affectionate shade<br />of the victory flag that flies aloft<br />and sings wholeheartedly to the world the ever-expanding<br />renown of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh;<br />bearing that banner of all transcendental benedictions,<br />Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh ever shines resplendent<br />in all its divine magnificence.]"},{"class":"b50","text":" One day his godbrother Sakhī Bābu, after hearing this verse, told his other godbrothers, “Śrīla Guru Mahārāj has nothing except a thatched house, but he has erected a very long bamboo pole with a flag on top, and has then composed this śloka!” But Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said to him, “You will see in future what will be here.” And later he has come to see what has manifest, as have we all."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> What size was the original thatched room?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> That building was twenty feet long by about twelve feet wide. At first there was not even a bed, but with some bamboo Śrīla Guru Mahārāj presently constructed two. It was perhaps a few months or a year later that the brahmachārīs came and built a house out of bamboo with a corrugated tin roof. When I joined I first stayed in that house."},{"class":"b44","text":" Giridhārī was in a thatched room measuring about six feet by ten feet made by Guru Mahārāj beside his own room. It was where the present kitchen and bhoga storeroom stand. After maybe one or two years Guru Mahārāj’s present building was constructed. Its picture is on the front of our <span class=\\"e3\\">Gauḍīya Gītāñjali</span> book of kīrtans. When I joined here on Nṛsiṁha Chaturdaśī day of 1946 or ’47 I saw that building. It was then about two years old. The building was made by a donation of bricks from a nearby brickfield owner. The third generation of the man who gave the bricks still comes here and they are very respectful always. Several members of that family came and took dīkṣā from this Maṭh."},{"class":"b44","text":" The building was made from earth and bricks and was covered by plaster. No cement was used. Until today it is standing, though I need to repair it from time to time. The upper floor of the building was built much later and is constructed using cement."},{"class":"b44","text":" Giridhārī and Mahāprabhu were installed there by Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. In the right hand room where Śrīpād Araṇya Mahārāj now stays is where Mahāprabhu used to be. When I joined here Śrīla Guru Mahārāj lived in the room to the left of Mahāprabhu, and later Śrīla Guru Mahārāj came to stay in the right hand room and Mahāprabhu moved to the left room."},{"class":"b44","text":" I made two latrines, one for the brahmachārīs’ room where Hari Charaṇ Prabhu now stays, and the other for Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s room. Around 1957 when we made the room upstairs for Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, I moved into Guru Mahārāj’s old room."},{"class":"b44","text":" The first brahmachārīs who came wanted to serve Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, but some came with some inner intention. It was their understanding from his horoscope that he would not live for more than 58 years; furthermore his health was not very strong and three or four times each month he would be very sick with severe headaches. They did not consider Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would live very long and they thought that after his disappearance they would become the proprietors of this Maṭh. But Śrīla Guru Mahārāj did not tell any of them that they would be chief sevāite or proprietor of the Maṭh. This was because he wanted to maintain his preceptorial line as well as his Guru-paramparā."},{"class":"b51","text":" The Guru-paramparā descends through the disciples, therefore Śrīla Guru Mahārāj searched for someone a little younger who he could train up to continue his paramparā. It was under such circumstances that I joined in 1947, and after talking with me Śrīla Guru Mahārāj decided within seven days that he would train me to be his successor. He could not hide anything, and he expressed this wish to Kṛṣṇadās Bābājī Mahārāj, Ramā Didi, Gopāl’s mother, his aunt, Kṛṣṇamayī Didi, his godbrothers, and others."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> In those days what was the daily routine?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> There was a full programme of worship."},{"class":"b51","text":" Mahāprabhu was installed in 1944 or ’45, so on the altar were Mahāprabhu and Giridhārī.

He requested Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, “I have two houses, one of which I am living in with my family. The other has a laboratory downstairs. I shall give you the free use of two rooms above the laboratory for the purpose of preaching. In order to have your association I can spare these two rooms. If you will kindly go there and stay, I shall be very happy.” This is how the 7 Sitakanta Banerjee Lane branch of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh was begun."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> Śrīla Guru Mahārāj particularly came to Koladwīp to be withdrawn from the preaching field, so was it purely Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj’s petition that led him to start another Maṭh in order to preach in Kolkata?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> Śrīla Guru Mahārāj always wanted to stay in the background. He did not want to take a prominent role to recruit others, make disciples, and so on. But Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj very much wanted to do something: to make another Gauḍīya Mission headed by our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. He many times told Śrīla Guru Mahārāj his wish, but Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was not enthusiastic to do so. It was because of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s close, affectionate relationship with Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj that he accepted his proposal."},{"class":"b51","text":" During their stay in Sitakanta Banerjee Lane some very prominent people came to see Śrīla Guru Mahārāj through Swāmī Mahārāj, and in that way some gṛhastha devotees joined. Bhutabṛt Prabhu and Nṛsiṁhānanda Prabhu were big brahmachārīs, and they also stayed in Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj’s house and preached in Kolkata. From time to time Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would go there, and he would sometimes stay for two or three months during which time the other brahmachārīs would run the Maṭh here in Nabadwīp."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> What service duties were here for those in the Maṭh?"},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> At that time all the regular temple programmes were running as well as cultivation. When I joined I made a very nice flower garden in front of the building. Also we cultivated vegetables and fruits. One day we picked a ten foot long ‘stick-sabji’ plant from the garden and took it to Sakhī Bābu’s house. He was greatly surprised to see it."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> When most devotees think of the Maṭh, they first of all think of the Temple. When did it begin to manifest?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> Construction was begun on the Temple after the first group of brahmachārīs left to start their own mission. A new group came to stay here which was mainly made up of the direct disciples of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. That new group consisted of myself, Hari Charaṇ Prabhu, Kṛṣṇa Śaraṇ Prabhu (now Śrīpād Araṇya Mahārāj), and another two or three devotees. We stayed here and also we would go preaching outstation. We would go house to house to tell the people about Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, and to beg alms. This was first begun by Jājāvar Mahārāj, Goswāmī Mahārāj, and Madhusūdan Mahārāj, who all helped Śrīla Guru Mahārāj after the first group of brahmachārīs left Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh. They were the first to start and establish the preaching for Guru Mahārāj and they collected also. We went with them, and in later years when they stopped, we continued the collection from that same field."},{"class":"b44","text":" Each of those sannyāsīs had their own Mission, but they collected for Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Madhusūdan Mahārāj’s Maṭh is in Burdwan, Jājāvar Mahārāj has two or three, and Goswāmī Mahārāj has many Maṭhs, but they each would come to preach and collect for Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. We would take them and they would head our group. By their preaching, some rice, bhoga, and money came. In this way they helped Śrīla Guru Mahārāj."},{"class":"b44","text":" Even when Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh was just two thatched houses, there would be many thousands of people coming to attend the festivals and to take prasādam—just like now. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was able to provide prasādam for everyone by the energy of the devotees’ collection. Every year Madhusūdan Mahārāj would go to collect for the festivals with us, and sometimes Jājāvar Mahārāj would also come."},{"class":"b44","text":" The first Nabadwīp Dhām Parikramā was started by myself under the guidance of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. I proposed to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj that if we could start a Nabadwīp Dhām Parikramā, it would not be difficult to find people to participate. When going out on the collections and meeting the many villagers I would have the chance to encourage many people to join our parikramā."},{"class":"b44","text":" At that time only two other parties did Nabadwīp Dhām Parikramā: Keśav Mahārāj and the Māyāpur Maṭh."},{"class":"b44","text":" Goswāmī Mahārāj, Jājāvar Mahārāj, and Madhusūdan Mahārāj joined with our parikramā party along with their many disciples and followers. They would all come here in Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh at festival times. Their parties were big, and we would put up a temporary tent for their accommodation. Goswāmī Mahārāj’s party itself consisted of maybe two hundred followers, mainly gṛhastha villagers. Jājāvar Mahārāj’s party was about a hundred persons, our own maybe two hundred, and Madhusūdan Mahārāj would have about fifty. In this way many people came and joined with our parikramā party. We continued in that way for a few years."},{"class":"b51","text":" After that, Mādhav Mahārāj also started to make Nabadwīp Dhām Parikramā. Then, by the will of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, Goswāmī Mahārāj made his Maṭh in Māyāpur—the Nandan Āchārya Bhavan Temple—and he too started Nabadwīp Dhām Parikramā. Jājāvar Mahārāj’s party joined with Mādhav Mahārāj, and from that time our own parikramā continued independently. Every year since then there has been Nabadwīp Dhām Parikramā from Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> I heard that parikramās to other holy places were also arranged."},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> I took pilgrimage parties to other places in India, including Badarik Ashram, and so did Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. At that time I wasn’t so expert at collecting funds, especially in Kolkata, but our expenses increased day by day. Furthermore no temple building had yet been constructed."},{"class":"b44","text":" I had noticed that Keśav Mahārāj, Chaitanya Maṭh, and Goswāmī Mahārāj were all running Indian tours. Therefore I proposed to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj that we could also organise Indian tours, part by part: Southern India, Northern India, Western India, and so on. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj replied, “If you can, that will be very good.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The success of such a journey would very much depend on the cooperation of the railway company, so I suggested to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj that if we go to Badarik Ashram, then it would entail the least reliance upon the railways. Then there would be a greater chance of success for the tour. To do that would entail taking the Doon Express to Haridvar and then a bus to Rishikesh, from where the journey would continue by foot. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj commented, “It would be an arduous journey. Can you organise and run it successfully?” I said, “Yes. If you give your grace, I can.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj gave me enthusiasm and said, “If you can, it will be very good.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, myself and other devotees, we went and gathered people for the tour. With the help of our patrons we advertised by distributing handbills from door to door."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the first party were about fifty-four persons. Myself and Paramahaṁsa Mahārāj—a sannyās disciple of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj who also helped him very much by collection and preaching—we took charge of the party. I was very young at that time, around twenty-four years old. For that first tour Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said it was necessary for an older devotee to also head the party, therefore he invited Paramahaṁsa Mahārāj. Actually I was in charge, but Paramahaṁsa Mahārāj was very helpful. Each year we would go to Kedarnath, Badarik Ashram, and Tunganath."},{"class":"b44","text":" After that we started various parikramā tours to the holy places of Southern India, Western India, Purī, Vṛndāvan, Dvārakā, and so on. These tours would all go to holy places. We established good relations with many people, and many of them also took initiation from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Many of the participants became devotees. In addition, by those tours we were able to collect much money at that time. I can remember that each tour would make at least Rs 5,000. With our nourishment they were very happy."},{"class":"b51","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj also came with us on three or four occasions. He went on the train tours and also on the pilgrimage by foot to Badarik Ashram. By that time the bus ran into the Himalayas all the way up to Rudra Prayag or maybe Chāmauli. When we first started, the whole journey by foot was about 286 kilometres and it took one month to complete."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> In order that Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was able to go on these tours his health must have improved considerably."},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> Yes. Although Guru Mahārāj’s health was not so good he would still go on these tours."},{"class":"b44","text":" You would be surprised to hear that at that time no qualified person was in Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh who could maintain his Mission. When he was fifty-five years old Śrīla Guru Mahārāj made a will. He made me the Sevāite and Āchārya; Goswāmī Mahārāj, Jājāvar Mahārāj, and Guru Mahārāj’s godbrother, Sakhī Bābu, were trustees, and perhaps Paramahaṁsa Mahārāj was an adviser. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj thought that they would stay and he would leave, and therefore he made them trustees, but they all left this world before him. In 1964, a few years after he passed the fifty-eight years that some expected him to live, he made a registered “Deed of Gift and Settlement”."},{"class":"b44","text":" He installed Gāndharvā Govindasundar about four years after I came to the Mission."},{"class":"b44","text":" The Temple was begun perhaps in 1955. First there was one thatched house, then a second, then the building of bricks, mud, and plaster, and after that gradually came the other buildings. The year I went to Badarik Ashram we collected Rs 5,000, and on returning I proposed to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj that we shall make a Temple. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said, “With only Rs 5,000 what will you be able to make?” By the desire of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj I then called Jājāvar Mahārāj. He came and Madhusūdan Mahārāj also came. It was Gaura Pūrṇimā time, and they went preaching for the festival to be held here. At that time a big donor came: Kiśorī Mohan Dās Vairāgya. His name is on the first of the marble plaques beside the Mandir. With his promise to give money for the Temple, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj started the construction. I don’t have a clear memory of historical dates but it was maybe 1955. Kiśorī Bābu then gave maybe ten or twelve thousand rupees—a lot of money at that time."},{"class":"b51","text":" At first the raised Deity room and roof were finished but there was no veranda. Then the veranda came, after which Śrīla Guru Mahārāj installed there the Deity. I can remember that the first abhiṣek of the Deity was in the old building. The Deity therefore must have first been installed there."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> When the Temple was only a temple room with no veranda, where did the devotees do bhajan?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> The devotees held bhajan in a thatched shed in front the Temple, like a small Naṭ Mandir. It was made of bamboo and corrugated tin sheet. Another person, a lady, also gave some money towards the Naṭ Mandir."},{"class":"b51","text":" A little later when Kiśorī Bābu left his body, only the ground floor of the Temple had been completed. In order to raise funds to continue building, some devotees of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj made further collections in addition to the annual parikramā tours by train and the Badarik Ashram pilgrimage. We continued those tours every year from 1953 until 1979. After Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj’s disappearance when the Western devotees started coming, I no longer had the time to make the parikramās. Also some money started coming in from other sources, so for various reasons we stopped the parikramās. We are very few devotees here, and mainly it was due to a shortage of time that the parikramās were stopped."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> How long did it take to build the Temple?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> The Temple took twenty years to build, and when it was completed there was still no Naṭ Mandir. Around 1975 a lady devotee of Guru Mahārāj promised Rs 5,000 and we started the construction of the Naṭ Mandir."},{"class":"b44","text":" Up until close to the time of the completion of the Temple there was only one other building of bricks: the building of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. The Naṭ Mandir was built after 1975 as was the gośālā [cowshed] by my present house. This building where I now stay was made also around that time. This was not originally to be my house but it was intended to be the kitchen."},{"class":"b44","text":" One devotee, Banoyārī Lāl Siṁhāniyā, wanted to fulfil the wish of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj to make a kitchen building. I considered it would be good to make a two-storey building so cooking could continue above water-level during the time of flooding. Sometimes the water is more than five feet deep. So by making a two-storey kitchen, when the flood comes we could move everything upstairs and still be able to cook. Throughout the rest of the year we could cook downstairs, and during festivals we could cook upstairs as well as down."},{"class":"b44","text":" When Śrīla Guru Mahārāj saw it, he told me, “Now you should take the upstairs section and live there.” Previously I lived in the small southerly room on the roof of the Naṭ Mandir, but that was not sufficiently big for my many books and other things."},{"class":"b44","text":" Another factor that decided my move was that especially in the rainy season it was quite far from the two-storey kitchen to the Temple. The path became slippery and it was difficult to take bhoga from this building all the way to the Temple every day. Therefore, for convenience, the devotees still tended to use the old small kitchen close to the Temple."},{"class":"b44","text":" Many big festivals happen here and at those times we would use this kitchen below my room, but generally throughout the year the small kitchen would be used."},{"class":"b44","text":" As they were using the small old kitchen so much, I asked Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, “Now we have some chance of money, shall I make a big new kitchen at the site of the old small one close to the Temple?” He agreed. The old kitchen was then demolished and nicely rebuilt; and that is the kitchen which is now used all the time."},{"class":"b44","text":" I came to stay in my present room in maybe 1982."},{"class":"b44","text":" In 1973 the Temple was completed. Then the double-storey kitchen was made and the Naṭ Mandir was begun. The houses where Kṛṣṇamayī Didi and Śaṅkarī Didi used to live were constructed earlier, about 1963, as was a third house where Dharma Didi used to stay."},{"class":"b44","text":" Gradually the Maṭh’s land area increased during the time the Temple was being built. Siṁhajuli, where the rice is grown for the Maṭh, was purchased in 1962. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj himself used to oversee the cultivation of that land. During cultivation we would go there daily by bicycle, but Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would go only every few days and he would take a rickshaw. At that time the eight kilometre journey cost two rupees. Only if necessary would he go daily. Satīṣ Prabhu also helped much with the cultivation in Siṁhajuli."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the very early days of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh, Satīṣ Prabhu stayed here. Nobody wanted to stay without a roof, but Satīṣ Prabhu happily stayed here and he helped Śrīla Guru Mahārāj to make the thatched house. He was the very first person to come and stay on the land after Śrīla Guru Mahārāj purchased it."},{"class":"b51","text":" Guru Mahārāj himself planted the compound hedge and he did much other physical labouring work around the Maṭh. I also helped Śrīla Guru Mahārāj with the labouring duties in the Maṭh compound."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> Are labourers hired to assist with the cultivation?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> Generally the cultivation is done by the brahmachārīs of the Maṭh, but at certain times extra labour is hired. Around 1962 we purchased two very big and strong male buffaloes to help with the cultivation. I was the driver of the buffaloes and they were very happy with me. They were very broad and strong, and they were so big it is not easy to imagine. The cross-bars on the cart were especially wide for the buffaloes to fit in."},{"class":"b44","text":" Those buffaloes would play with me here, but Śrīla Guru Mahārāj would be afraid they may kill me. They were big, strong, and young, and Guru Mahārāj did not like that I would always mix with them."},{"class":"b44","text":" In order to feed them grass I would take them to the pasture in front of Mahāprabhu’s Temple. One day I was with them there and Śrīla Guru Mahārāj told me, “Don’t go close to the buffaloes.” But I assured him, “These buffaloes will not attack me.” He objected, “These are beasts, they can attack you.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" I replied, “No, Mahārāj, these are not like beasts.” Then I went in front of the biggest buffalo, quickly went over to his rear, and thumped him on his leg. Then, like a kid goat, he quickly turned, and with his horns he put his head against my body, but very carefully. Seeing this, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj said, “Oh, he will not attack you?” I reassured him that he would not. Again I did it many times. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj watched and was surprised to see that each time the buffalo appeared to be quickly going to attack I would raise my arm slightly and he would put his horns carefully there by my side in a playing way. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was surprised to see that such a strong red-eyed buffalo, of whom everyone was fearful, was playing with me."},{"class":"b51","text":" That buffalo’s name was Rāmdās. The other buffalo was called Śyāmdās. When Śyāmdās died, I purchased another named Haridās. They were very strong, and they ploughed the fields, pulled carts, and so on."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> We are often asked what happens to the old cows here at the Maṭh."},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> Generally a cow will stay here all its life. The cows generally grow old and die here, though sometimes we do sell them when we have too many. When a cow becomes very old we will not sell her. We only sell cows that produce milk or that can have calves, and only do so if there is an excess of cows."},{"class":"b44","text":" There were two cows here when I first came. One was white and named Surabhi, and the other was named Śyāmalī. Śyāmalī was very naughty and she attacked everyone. I think she probably wasn’t happy with her food."},{"class":"b44","text":" In my youth I had been accustomed to drinking much milk, but after three or four years in the Maṭh I became sick, and was diagnosed by the doctor to be suffering from a lack of milk. I was very sick and the doctor prescribed one or two apples and a kilogram of milk daily. I suggested to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, “I would like to do sevā of Śyāmalī, then she will give enough milk for me, in that way it won’t be necessary to purchase any additional quantity from the market.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj readily and happily agreed. At that time Śyāmalī was giving 2.5 kg of milk each day, but after I started to serve her she became very happy and gave up to 6.25 kg. When I would go to Kolkata she gave less milk, and when I would return she would give more. We didn’t have many cows at that time. Śyāmalī was the first cow, then Surabhi, and then Nandinī came a little later."},{"class":"b51","text":" Later still, when more cows came, the gośālā was constructed. At first we purchased some cows, but since then all the cows have been either bred here, or donated."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> In what way are we to understand the spiritual qualities of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> We can have some idea of the spiritual nature of the Maṭh from what Śrīla Guru Mahārāj has said. Hearing his words and conception our own vision has grown. When Sakhī Bābu one day jokingly said, “Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj has only erected a tall bamboo flagstaff, but he has composed such a grand śloka!” Śrīla Guru Mahārāj responded, “In the future you will see what will manifest.” Lastly we can see what has come here—and not only the buildings. When the ground floor of the Temple was completed, the Koladwīp Adhipati, the Master of Koladwīp, Lakṣmī-Varāhadev, in the form of a Śālagrām-śilā Deity, came here gradually, by His wish. He was living like a king in a brāhmaṇ’s house, from where He came here through Jājāvar Mahārāj and Goswāmī Mahārāj. When He first arrived here, we did not know what type of Śālagrām-śilā had come, but under instruction from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj I searched the <span class=\\"e3\\">Garuḍa-purāṇa</span> to identify the name of the Śālagrām-śilā according to His markings. From that I considered Him to be Lakṣmī-Varāhadev. In order to double-check my conclusion, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj wrote a letter to the brāhmaṇ who had been caring for Him. He replied confirming the Śālagrām to indeed be Lakṣmī-Varāhadev. He also mentioned in his reply that if a brāhmaṇ brahmachārī will serve Him, then He will be very happy."},{"class":"b44","text":" Hearing this, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj told me, “Arrange for Lakṣmī-Varāhadev to have special paramānna [sweet-rice] every day. In that way He will be happy and the Maṭh will be very peaceful.” Since that day a brāhmaṇ brahmachārī has always been doing His worship, and daily offering paramānna."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj saw Nabadwīp Dhām as aparādha-bhañjan-pāṭ, and Koladwīp as the kṣetra, the land, of Lakṣmī-Varāhadev. <span class=\\"e3\\">Kola</span> means Varāhadev. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, with his transcendental vision, has seen what is actually here. We consider that what is manifesting is in Koladwīp, and by devotional service it is becoming revealed gradually."},{"class":"b44","text":" Especially when Śrīla Guru Mahārāj disappeared we have seen some special symptoms. From my youth I always tried to see that all the trees and all the paraphernalia of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh are not mundane. Actually, with my sense of vision I always consider everything here to be transcendental. I do not know how much I can feel, but I have no doubt that sometimes I feel it to be transcendental. We have also seen many symptoms."},{"class":"b51","text":" In my younger days I would sometimes be a little angry and would want to leave the Maṭh, but at that time I always asked permission to go from the trees, cows, and other living entities. Therefore I can understand I have some feeling for everything here, otherwise why did I go to ask permission from tree to tree? Furthermore, they didn’t give permission for me to go! Whether or not I see correctly, I can say I have some standard feelings given in the scriptures of how to see the Holy Dhām and its paraphernalia. Through knowledge and the vision of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj we are trying to see—and sometimes we are able to see also."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> What advice did Śrīla Guru Mahārāj give as to how to see this place?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> He said this is a very auspicious place, and specifically it is Gupta Govardhan. Close to Govardhan Hill is Mānasa Gaṅgā, and Govinda Kuṇḍa is also here in remembrance of Govinda Kuṇḍa by Govardhan. In Vṛndāvan is Mānasa Gaṅgā, and here in Nabadwīp is the Ganges. In Govardhan the līlā of Kṛṣṇa goes on in many ways, and here also the līlā of Gāndharvā and Govindasundar takes place: the Pastimes of the Lord near Govinda Kuṇḍa of Vṛndāvan are happening here. And we remember Kusum Sarovar also, but until now I haven’t made it because time has been short due to the many services going on in our various centres here in India. I have always wanted to excavate the hole behind the Indians’ guesthouse and make it into Kusum Sarovar. That was my plan, and I asked Guru Mahārāj if we could dig there a nice kuṇḍa with steps going down into it.

Even Mukti Devī will try to serve that devotee, and will request of him, “What is my service? Please give me some service in your service world.” If we try to see, we can see that it is true. For one who wants to pleasingly serve his Divine Master, dharma, artha, kāma, and mokṣa—everything—want to serve him.

With almost the whole year being finished Duryodhan became very hopeless and he called a meeting of his top men. In that meeting Bhīṣmadev said to him, “You can’t find the Pāṇḍavas? There are five of them but you cannot find even one?” Bhīṣmadev then smiled and said to all those in that grand assembly, “You are foolish. You are searching in the wrong places because you do not know the proper way to search for them. Searching in the caves, the mountains, the jungles, and so forth, is not the process. Actually, wherever the Pāṇḍavas live you will be able to see the symptoms of their presence. Wherever they are present the cows will give much milk, the trees will bear much fruit, the crops will grow in abundance, the rains will fall timely, the rivers will flow very happily, the breeze will be fresh and clean, and in every way the whole environment will be prosperous.

One who tries to serve must receive some disturbance in this mundane world. One who does not try to serve will not be disturbed: he will simply be alone chanting on his beads without trying to exert any effort to serve. In such a way he will remain without disturbance—and without progress. But one who takes to the service-life must receive some disturbances, and that is also one kind of good symptom. If a sportsman runs but does not feel any pain in his legs, then that kind of running is not sufficient for him. It means he is not trying hard enough, and he won’t win the race in that way. With a relaxed mood, service is not possible for the beginners. Service is always difficult, and who can do that must be benefitted."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> We hear that the people of Nabadwīp are special people.

I was surprised because it was a very strong tree. Within twenty-four hours all its leaves fell off, and we could all understand that tree had left his body, but at the time we could not understand why he left. I thought the tree left because he could not tolerate the strong separation. He perhaps was very dear to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, and in deep separation he left. But later I discovered this to be not the only cause. Another two mango trees of similar size continued to live nearby, but this tree disappeared. Therefore I began to meditate further on why he left—and what actually is there. Then one day some feeling came within me. I felt that for the devotees attending ārati and other worship of Guru Mahārāj, two pillars would be necessary to support a roof to give them shade. One of those pillars would need to be close to the very point where that tree stood."},{"class":"b44","text":" It was my nature not to kill any tree in Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh. Only I will interfere with the trees for a very essential, unavoidable cause. If that particular mango tree had remained I would have settled for a lesser design of building rather than cut it down, therefore that tree himself disappeared. And now you can see how Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s Samādhi Mandir, The Temple of Union in Separation, has manifest there. Although I could not understand how the Temple would manifest, that tree could."},{"class":"b44","text":" By Rādhā Kuṇḍa in Śrī Dhām Vṛndāvan you can see six trees.

I always feel much happiness inside to touch and see the trees. I think it is the grace of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, and also the causeless mercy bestowed upon me by many Vaiṣṇavas, that these feelings and some good sense have come to me. Sometimes it may not be fully felt, but knowledge is helping us to see that everything is transcendental and everything is very auspicious."},{"class":"b44","text":" I have been in charge of making many things here in the Maṭh, but as much as possible I always try to avoid giving any pain to others.

You are disturbing me while I’m walking along the road. Kṛṣṇa, You are very naughty! I shall go to Mother Yaśodā and tell her what kind of naughtiness You have. Hearing that, she will beat You.” That kind of vision is very high, but it is real vision. When we shall have that kind of sight we shall see everything to be transcendental, and we won’t be able to see anything before us as mundane. That was the kind of vision of Gaura Kiśor Dās Bābājī Mahārāj, Vaṁśī Dās Bābājī Mahārāj, Jagannāth Dās Bābājī Mahārāj, Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād, and our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj.

What should we think, what should be our meditation, and what mood of glorification should we have especially at this time?"},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> Actually at first I was not so aware that this is the Golden Jubilee year, then suddenly it came to my attention and I immediately thought of my Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. I have seen in his character his glorification of the Vaiṣṇavas, of Mahāprabhu with His associates, and of the Dhām. We saw that he likes very much to engage in service to the Vaiṣṇavas, Guru, Mahāprabhu, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, and Nabadwīp Dhām. Whenever I would propose something within these categories, he would become very happy and would immediately give his sanction. So when it came to my notice that this year is the Golden Jubilee year, I thought that if I were to tell Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, “This year is the Golden Jubilee, I want to make some festival for that. Everyone observes a Golden Jubilee as a traditionally festive year for all sorts of organisations, whether businesses, institutions, or whatever. Now is coming the Golden Jubilee year of our Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh so I wish also to make some special arrangements”, I know he would give his permission happily. He would not only give his permission, but if I were to ask him to write an article for a Golden Jubilee publication, he, although unable to see or write, would certainly speak something into a tape recorder. I feel this very strongly."},{"class":"b44","text":" Whenever I wanted to start any new sevā programme I would always ask Śrīla Guru Mahārāj first to see if he would be happy or not. But he never gave a negative answer: he always answered in the affirmative. Whether I wish to go to Badarik Ashram, or if I wish to go to Rāmeśvaram, for the service of Mahāprabhu he always gave his permission. Therefore, when the inspiration came to me to make extra programmes of glorification and celebration during this Golden Jubilee year, I thought, “Yes, I must try.” Even I thought that even if no one will help me and I am unable to do anything on a big scale, at least I must print something. In this way I prepared myself and started. Now I see that everyone is very enthusiastic for the Golden Jubilee year festivals, therefore I am more and more happy. This year many things have already happened for the remembrance of the Golden Jubilee, and many other activities worldwide are planned and are in the making."},{"class":"b44","text":" Actually, for the quick manifestation of service, some special occasion is often necessary.

We can make flower gardens and vegetable gardens for Guru Gaurāṅga Gāndharvā Govindasundar. And for Their satisfaction we can cultivate rice, serve the cows by feeding them, washing them, and cleaning their gośālā; and we can engage in any number of activities.

They can start weekly weekend meetings, and they can inaugurate a main annual meeting with festivals and prasādam distribution as well as two or three other large festivals yearly. They can do many things in their countries in remembrance of Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh’s Golden Jubilee. At least everyone can chant, engage in glorification, and make some meetings. If it is possible, I may be able to send to their countries from here Śrīpād Bhakti Ānanda Sāgar Mahārāj or others. I am also eager to meet with the devotees in the West, and if it is the desire of Kṛṣṇa, it must happen."},{"class":"b51","text":" My nature is to be hopeful.

Rūpa Goswāmī said that sometimes the devotees may be a little disappointed also (ghana-taralā), but mostly the devotees are very enthusiastic in the association of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa always gives us His association, and if we have the capacity, we can recognise it immediately."},{"class":"b51","text":" When many problems are in front of me, I am eager to solve everything immediately, but it is not possible immediately.

He always wants full service, not partial service. But Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was mainly very accommodative in that way: he always accepted even partial service from the devotees. That is not the nature of Swāmī Mahārāj: he wants always to take the full energy of the devotees. It is Guru Mahārāj’s desire also, but he would look and give his mercy wherever any service was done; and that gives more hope to the devotees. But the devotees must try in the line of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj! And I like that also. Twenty-four hours per day service to Śrī Guru and Vaiṣṇava is necessary, but if it is not possible to do so for a whole year, then the minimum is to give that type of service for at least a few days."},{"class":"b50","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Question:</span> All the devotees are very indebted always to Your Divine Grace, even more so that you have taken the time and trouble to talk with us today."},{"class":"b43","text":" <span class=\\"e2\\">Śrīla Mahārāj:</span> I also tried in this way to draw something from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj for the devotees.

He was very renounced and would take as his prasādam only some soft rice with one green chilli. He would keep that rice in a pot for three or four days and each day he would take some from there along with one green chilli. He would take such type of prasādam, but he would always be engaged in his bhajan. And where would he be doing his bhajan? In a public latrine. His residence was a cubicle of a public latrine. People will not go to such a place because it is very dirty, but he lived there. You also cannot imitate him."},{"class":"b44","text":" An example of Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur’s nature is that in his earlier days he lived in the place where now stands the Śrī Chaitanya Maṭh, Māyāpur. During the time of chāturmāsya he would not use his hand to eat but he would take directly with his mouth from the ground, and he would chant one crore of Hari-nām [ten million Holy Names] in one month. In those earlier days he would continuously chant Hari-nām and would take only three or four mouthfuls of food; and that too directly from the ground.

You cannot imitate him."},{"class":"b44","text":" Our Śrīla Guru Mahārāj also in his earlier days in the Gauḍīya Maṭh would take very watery dal and poor quality mashed vegetables along with rice.

I would also massage his feet and give nerve massage. At that time no woman, including his sister, Ramā Didi, could go inside Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s room."},{"class":"b44","text":" On my first day at the Maṭh I saw Ramā Didi arrive from her father-in-law’s house.

Her family knew Śrīla Guru Mahārāj since childhood as Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was their relative and also came from a very prominent smārta brāhmaṇ family. Outwardly, therefore, they did not say anything wrong to Kṛṣṇamayī Didi, but they expressed their objection in many ways. She did not listen to them, and told, “I have a great Guru, and I cannot leave his lotus feet.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" When her very good son-in-law died she became very distressed and could not remain living in her house. She came to take shelter of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and offered her house to him.

He made one small single-roomed bungalow for her to live in. It is known as Ramā Dhām, and is where she now stays."},{"class":"b44","text":" The first lady to help Śrīla Guru Mahārāj in the Maṭh was Ramā Didi.

Even Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s godbrothers would not walk along the veranda outside his room for fear of disturbing him even though they were living in the adjacent room to his quarters.

Seeing Śrīla Prabhupād’s intention to accommodate everyone it became necessary to change some of the main rules and regulations."},{"class":"b44","text":" One day Śrīpād Bhakti Hṛday Bon Mahārāj brought two Western devotees to the Bag Bazaar Gauḍīya Maṭh. They went to bathe at the big cement water tub, but the two of them jumped into that water tank stark naked as everybody watched with surprise. The tank was set beside a wall, and from the opposite side of the wall the neighbours also could see easily, and they objected. A report came to Śrīla Prabhupād, “Mahārāj, they do not know the courtesy of India. Following the custom of their own country they jumped naked into the water tank.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Hearing this news, Śrīla Prabhupād replied, “Don’t stop them, that is their habit, but make there a shed so people cannot see but they can play.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" No doubt it was explained to them what is courtesy in India and therefore bathing naked should not be done, but Śrīla Prabhupād’s thinking was, “Again other Western devotees will come and they also will not know the local customs. For everyone to learn immediately by hearing is not possible, so first a shed should be erected in order to prevent others from being offended, and then we can try to teach the newcomer Westerners.” In this way when the Western and Eastern cultures mixed there has been a relaxation of rules and regulations."},{"class":"b44","text":" There is another example that many of you have been witness to. One Western lady disciple of Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj was staying here. During that time she would daily make some pizza and other offerings for Śrīpād Jayatīrtha Mahārāj, but she very much wanted that her offerings be also accepted by Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was from a very high smārta brāhmaṇ family and that lady was very unhappy and crying because she was unable to offer any preparations to him. Seeing her mood I told her one day, “After Śrīla Guru Mahārāj has taken his bath and completed his japa, bring your offering plate and I shall make some arrangement.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" She came with her plate of pizza, vegetables, and other things, and duly waited.

He was seated on an āsan and I was seated opposite him. He was talking very happily with me and he described the activities of his preaching mission in the West by way of a report for Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. At that time a very active and jolly girl came quickly and took something from the shelf behind Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj. She was very pretty and Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj asked me, “Do you know where I found this girl?” Very loudly he told me, “I collected her from a Hawaiian beach but now she is a very good devotee and is serving nicely, sometimes even serving me personally.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" He told me that she would every day see the devotees giving him a foot massage, but she was very unhappy because she herself was not allowed to do so. He explained, “One day she was crying in front of me, ‘Oh, I want to massage your feet.’ So on that day I gave her my feet and said, ‘Today you massage them.’” In this way Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj very happily related this incident."},{"class":"b44","text":" So we can see that the traditional customs of conduct have changed now. But it was Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād who gave us this seed. When there was a proposal to serve non-vegetarian food in order to attract Indian students and Westerners to hear about Mahāprabhu at a student home connected with the Gauḍīya Maṭh, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj commented to Śrīla Prabhupād, “No Mahārāj, if you make outside arrangements for the students to take their customary Western food in our student home it will not appear to be good in the eyes of other Indians and they will insult us.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" But Śrīla Prabhupād replied, “I considered this point one thousand births ago. For the service of Kṛṣṇa we must be Vaikuṇṭha-vṛtti.” Vaikuṇṭha-vṛtti means that we can do everything for the service of Kṛṣṇa. This type of mood is necessary."},{"class":"b44","text":" But sometimes the devotees misuse that mood. I heard from some devotees that during their preaching activities they were living in a hotel. They rented one room for four persons but, by deceiving the proprietor, eight devotees used that one room along with its facilities. Not only that, but when leaving, they stole the blankets, towels, and other things, saying to themselves that those items are all the property of Kṛṣṇa. They stole with the conception, “Oh, everything is for the service of Kṛṣṇa and therefore we can take it.” In this way they misused that principle."},{"class":"b44","text":" Swāmī Mahārāj said, “Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa and is for Kṛṣṇa, therefore you can do anything for the service of Kṛṣṇa.” That was his order but they think it also includes stealing. That is misuse. The environment must be maintained so that we shall not disturb others. Without disturbing the rules and others, you can maintain your devotional life: that is the teaching of Mahāprabhu, Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj, and Śrīla Guru Mahārāj. Misuse is a disturbance to others. Not only that but they will think the devotees to be thieves. In future they will think in this way and a bad name will come to the devotees. But those devotees were very enthusiastic and did not care about that."},{"class":"b44","text":" I heard from one lady devotee also a story that an old man showed her a hundred dollar note and asked her to sit and talk with him. He was feeling very lonely and offered her the note. This lady devotee then sat there and after talking only a few words together she snatched that hundred dollar note from his hand and ran away. In this way sometimes many things happen and the collection by the devotees goes in a wrong way."},{"class":"b44","text":" When a mission is very big it is difficult to prevent some wrong conduct from happening. Where only ten or twenty persons live, the rules and regulations can all be maintained nicely, but where thousands of people live, there must come some breakdown of the rules. No doubt there are basic guidelines, but the devotees are very enthusiastic. They are willing to jump into the poisonous Kāliya Lake expecting Kṛṣṇa’s protection."},{"class":"b51","text":" Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur said,"},{"class":"b60","text":" rakṣā karabi tuhu̐ niśchaya jāni<br />pāna karabu̐ hāma yāmuna-pāni"},{"class":"b43","text":" “I can easily drink the poisonous water of the Yamunā because I know that Kṛṣṇa must protect me.” In this way enthusiasm first comes. <span class=\\"e3\\">Utsāhān niśchayād dhairyāt</span>. This is one of the first symptoms of devotion."},{"class":"b44","text":" Utsāha-mayī, ghana-taralā, vyūḍha-vikalpā, viṣaya-saṅgarā, niyamākṣamā, taraṅga-raṅgiṇī: many kinds of nature come in the practitioner’s life. The first life is utsāha, they become very enthusiastic and sometimes do some wrong. It is necessary to gain understanding gradually, then less difficulty will come. It is impossible for us to know everything, and no doubt some difficulty must come, but in the proper way we shall try to know what is devotional life, and in that way less difficulty will come to us."},{"class":"b52","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj always told that we need a living representative in order to harmonise and adjust things for time and place.

After reading the first lesson, the second lesson, and the third lesson, then you can read the fourth lesson. But by the time the Western devotees came to Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, he could not wait and therefore he expressed his fourth lesson. For example:"},{"class":"b60","text":" gāyatry-artha-viniryāsaṁ gītā-gūḍhārtha-gauravaṁ"},{"class":"b43","text":" He expressed the explanation of the gāyatrī-mantram which previously no one had done widely."},{"class":"b44","text":" I have been with Śrīla Guru Mahārāj for many years and I know his nature.

My thought is that it is not necessary to broadcast this. Why are you giving it?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj smiled and said, “Firstly, it has come in my heart and I cannot check myself. Secondly, if I do not give it, then I am thinking that nobody will be effective in giving it in the future. In the past it has not been given, and if in the future it will not be given, then I must give what I have now. You may control how it is published, but I must express my heart.” In this way Śrīla Guru Mahārāj gave the explanation of the gāyatrī-mantram to the world. But that is the last chapter of his manifest Pastimes, and all the devotees know it. Also you will not find that explanation given anywhere previously in any chapter of any of the other Āchāryas including Rūpa Goswāmī and Sanātan Goswāmī. I heard from Śrīla Guru Mahārāj that maybe Jīva Goswāmī gave some essence of that gāyatrī explanation but Śrīla Guru Mahārāj had not seen that. Recently I did find it given in Jīva Goswāmī’s writings, but there he gives only a hint of the meaning."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s conception is very high, and he gave that gāyatrī explanation in the last chapter of his life.

We must take this scripture into our hearts and then we shall be able to understand the other things. The first stage for us has been given by Śrīla Guru Mahārāj there.

There are many ślokas in <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā</span>, but some are especially worthy of mention, such as verses 9.30–31, 10.9, and 10.10. One time Śrīla Guru Mahārāj was discussing at length verses such as these with Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj and Śrīla Jājāvar Mahārāj. At that time Achyutānanda Prabhu and Rāmānuja Prabhu were there and they heard their Bengali conversation going on very happily, and for hour after hour. Śrīla Guru Mahārāj and Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj talked together for maybe two or three hours and then Swāmī Mahārāj returned to his quarters. He was staying in our Maṭh’s blue guesthouse at that time.

What was that subject matter?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Swāmī Mahārāj replied, “If you were to hear even the gist of that, you would faint, therefore it is not necessary for you to know!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Hearing such subject matters Jājāvar Mahārāj wanted to stop Śrīla Guru Mahārāj from speaking further."},{"class":"b51","text":" Lastly Śrī Rāmānanda Rāy expressed his own high explanation that is not expressively found in the scriptures:"},{"class":"b59","text":" pahilehi rāga nayana-bhaṅge bhela<br />anudina bāḍhala, avadhi nā gela"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrī Chaitanya-charitāmṛta: Madhya-līlā, 8.194)"},{"class":"b43","text":" While he was expressing that Bengali poetry, Mahāprabhu interrupted, “Hold your tongue, it is not necessary to express more.” And we also saw that Jājāvar Mahārāj wanted to hold Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s tongue: “Mahārāj, don’t say any more. You please stop.” This we have seen, and it is part of the last līlā of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj."},{"class":"b44","text":" Śrīla Guru Mahārāj expressed to me, “Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Prabhupād gave me the property and Nityānanda Prabhu ordered me: ‘You must try to give this to others’, therefore lastly I am trying to do so.

Who is able to understand shall understand it in future, but what I have I want to express now.” That was Śrīla Guru Mahārāj’s desire and in that way he gave such high conceptions. But if someone will try to read the fourth lesson without first reading from the beginning the first, second, and third lessons then that will be very hard and that also can be harmful."},{"class":"b44","text":" When I tried, by the order of Śrīla Guru Mahārāj, to read the <span class=\\"e3\\">Hari-nāmāmṛta-vyākaraṇa</span> in order to learn Sanskrit, there was one book, <span class=\\"e3\\">Amara-kośa</span>, the meaning of which I could not understand. Nobody can understand its meaning at first because it is only a book of words—a selection of words. It lists the main names of Viṣṇu, of Indra, and so many main alternative names of others. Everything in heaven has so many names, not just a single name, and Śrīla Guru Mahārāj instructed me, “You must memorise it otherwise you will not be able to write or read Sanskrit as you will not be able to understand its meaning.” To only memorise names without any meanings is very hard for me, but those first lessons are necessary. Yesterday I saw that book and was reminded of this."},{"class":"b44","text":" Therefore it is necessary to complete the first lesson, the second lesson, and the third lesson, then it is possible to understand the fourth lesson.
