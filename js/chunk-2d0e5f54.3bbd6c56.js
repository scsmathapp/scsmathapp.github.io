Almost everything depends upon consciousness. External sensations and perceptions all depend upon consciousness. A ‘thing’ means a perception of the thing by eye, or by touch. Everything that we experience in this world is a cluster of perceptions, sensations—and the whole thing is based on consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" So we are to search for the Master, the King of the conscious world. We have no engagement in this mundane world except to search for the cause, the prime cause. In different stages of life there is gradation of cause up to the land of beauty and love. We are to withdraw there. Back to God, back to home. Back to the centre. Home—not only consciousness."},{"class":"b44","text":" Consciousness is only on the way. Just as on a long journey there are so many hostels along the way, similarly, consciousness is on the way to the land of love and beauty—to the land of Kṛṣṇa. First we must cross consciousness, then we shall find sweetness, ānandam, rasam. Ānandam is controlling, not consciousness. Consciousness is the basis, but the real hankering of all of us is for happiness, ecstasy, ānandam, rasam. Rasa, beauty, is controlling, and that can satisfy our inner hankering—not jñān, knowledge, and not consciousness. Consciousness is not the integer. What to speak of this material energy, even consciousness cannot satisfy our inner hankering."},{"class":"b44","text":" The inner hankering is for satisfaction, happiness, sweetness, love, beauty, and mercy. Really the inner analysis of our heart is that we are all hankering for sweetness, for <span class=\\"e3\\">rasa</span>, but we are wandering hither and thither for that rasa, and frustrated we come back with a slap on our cheek. We are going for rasa, but frustrated, with a slap, we are coming back. In this way we are wandering endlessly, as dictated by the forces of the external nature. We are wandering hither and thither, but by this process we won’t find the proper thing."},{"class":"b44","text":" Fortunately the agents from the high level come to our relief. By various means, with or without us being aware of it, they inject some special news, which, when accumulated, creates such energy in us that, “I must go back to my home!” We are told that our home is such, and that our fortune is connected with such a form of life. We must return back there. That is the campaign of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that is the land of Vṛndāvan, the happiest domain, the most extensive plane which includes everything. It is not a part. This world is a negligible part of that infinite world, that infinite ocean of sweetness. All may be accommodated there."},{"class":"b44","text":" It is not idolatry, not hypnotism, not sentimentalism, not emotionalism, but it is concrete fact as much as we want happiness. The materialists are searching and thinking they are getting something; but by money and women they are becoming frustrated. What is apparent is not real. They are being deceived in such a way all through their lives more or less."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, we are fortunate if we receive guidance from the conscious friends in our life, who endeavour to recruit us to that domain: “Come to your senses. Come to your normal position. Come to your home. You are all misguided like crazy men, running hither and thither for happiness and pleasure, but you are not getting it, and this is common. The wild-goose-chasing of scientific researchers is trying to furnish you with more comforts of the transient, flickering type, but such attempts are going in the opposite direction."},{"class":"b44","text":" “They are inviting you to get more comforts by the help of the gross conception, but you will not find the real thing there. You will have to go inside. Home is necessary. Instead you are being carried to a foreign land, dependant upon a foreign thing for your happiness. But real happiness does not depend on the supply of these physical comforts, it is within. It lives within. It is an independent thing."},{"class":"b44","text":" “Stone and electricity cannot produce comfort for you. But that which can give comfort is superior in comparison to one who is searching like a crazy man for comfort. Real comfort holds a superior position to you. That which is inferior to you in nature will not give you comfort. Your thirst can be satisfied and fulfilled only from the higher region, not from the lower. Therefore do not be mad to find it in the lower, in the fossil, but direct your search to the higher realm and take guidance from those friends who endeavour to recruit you to that domain.”"},{"class":"b52","text":" To heed this call is the real wealth of life for each and every one of us."}]},{"title":"The Vision of Goodness","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b58","text":" Part Two"},{"class":"b47","text":" The Vision of Goodness"},{"class":"b50","text":" Basically the advice of <span class=\\"e3\\">Ṛg-veda</span>, the first Veda that descends from the upper world to this world, is: “The primary requirement for you all is to conceive that there is a world above, and ‘above’ means in the line of consciousness.

Here, you are in the atmosphere of exploitation, but that is the land of service. There, you have to think in terms of service. That is on your head. That region is superior to the stuff you are made of. So do you want that connection? Or do you prefer to reign in hell than to serve in heaven? What do you like? Consider, and then come forward.

If I am sick, I am not to just ask, “O God, cure my sickness!” And if I am poor, I should not only pray, “O God, give me money!” Such mercenary connection is not very happy, but still it has some meaning because at least there is thought that there is some supernatural power, and that He can do wonders. However, it is better to want God without expecting anything mundane from Him. We should want God—who is the source of all this opulence—and we should not want anything else which we consider valuable. We are to depend on Him: “O Lord, give me what is good. I am an imperfect being, I do not know what is good and what is bad. Please provide whatever You consider to be good for me.” This is an improvement over praying to Him for mundane benefits.

Service. “I want only Your service.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" At the beginning we might think we are losers, but ultimately we will gain.

None can deny it. None can say, “I don’t want love.” It is so universal. One may say, “I do not want any grandeur, any power”, but, “I do not want love”—never. Sometimes one may even go as far as to say, “I don’t want justice.” That may be possible. Of course, generally it may be the exception, but still it may be said, “I don’t want justice. By justice that man will suffer. Rather, I shall suffer, and that man be saved.” Just as Jesus Christ said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” By that prayer, Lord Christ set justice aside: “No, justice may go on this side, and let me be the sufferer.” We can take the risk of dismissing justice, but we can’t avoid love. We can give up everything but that love for love. If we have the eye to see, then we shall see that only to get love, prema, we can give up everything in the world. So how valuable is that thing? Mahāprabhu and <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> came with that."},{"class":"b44","text":" God takes the form of Kṛṣṇa in the plane of love, and that is the most fundamental and the most subtle plane behind this variegated creation. So come to that plane, try to penetrate into that plane, where God is Kṛṣṇa, and where the paraphernalia is Vṛndāvan. Anyhow try to have admission in that plane, and you will find there the happiest form of life."},{"class":"b44","text":" Mercy is more beautiful than justice. We cannot think of blaming the spirit of justice, but at the same time we cannot deny that there is mercy over justice. But one who can extend mercy over justice must have such power that he is able to give due compensation. The Lord has such power of compensation. Kṛṣṇa is such an aspect of the Lord. He can give mercy through love and affection, and by any means we want to live in that environment. Mahāprabhu came to show that to be the plane for which we should strive. And Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur said, “In no time the intelligentsia of the world will come to understand that this is the highest conception of attainment for all humans as well as of everything else in the whole of creation. The intelligentsia cannot be misguided for long by so many other proposals of the highest attainment which are only giving partial achievement. Many things are going on in religion in the name of the highest solution of our life, but what Mahāprabhu has given very soon will be detected by the intelligentsia of the world, and all will flock to the banner of Śrī Chaitanyadev and will sing the glory of Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The fulfilment of our heart’s satisfaction is in the Kṛṣṇa conception of the Absolute. He is the Lord of love, beauty, ecstasy, and happiness. He is our innermost necessity. Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu said, “Go straight to Vṛndāvan by this special train. Don’t try to break your journey anywhere, for that will only be a loss of time and energy.” In addition He said, “Whoever you find, give them Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is just as in a famine-stricken country, whoever you will find you will give some food to save him, but this is a hundred times more urgent, so you are to inject Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Tell them, ‘A loving Lord is above your head seeing everything. You only have to connect with Him and His servants. His servants are very, very kind and magnanimous.

Sometimes naiṣkarmya (a life without karma) received much appreciation within the society. They want to be without labour troubles.
