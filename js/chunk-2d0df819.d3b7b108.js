The sweet vibration of his kīrtan in the form of Hari-kathā continues to expand to the limits of the universe. Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj was once described as a “man of eternal mind”—such was the feeling of those persons fortunate enough to hear him speak about the spiritual world. The preciseness of his representation of siddhānta (devotional conclusions), the clarity of his theological and ontological analysis, the startling effectiveness and simplicity of his analogies, along with the extraordinary combination of gravity and, at times, child-like simplicity, marked him as truly unique. One felt he was the most genuine person one could ever meet. His own Guru Mahārāj Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur referred to him as “a man of substance”. Small wonder then that devotees from far and wide would seek him out for his reliable and final judgment on any matter of importance. Even many of those who were placed in ‘opposition’ to him eventually could not help but be charmed. When he himself once inquired from one such gentleman as to why, even while maintaining this frame of mind, he still continued to visit him regularly, the man replied: “Because of your deep intelligence, sound common sense, and disinterested nature.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" The present selection is from informal talks recorded at the Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh between 1982–85.

Once when His Divine Grace was searching for a fitting expression to describe Her inner and outer qualities, the devotees attending his talk at the time attempted to provide suitable expressions: “mood and luster”, “feeling and effulgence”, and several other such versions were put forward, but each time Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj shook his head, unsatisfied.

There is an expression “history repeats itself”, but that is in the similar nature of the event, not the actual fact; history repeats its nature, but what is gone, is gone. Once it has gone, it has gone forever. But in Kṛṣṇa-līlā, in the eternal world, it is not so. It may present the same thing every time, at every second; thus it is called nitya-līlā, ‘eternal Pastimes’—crossing the limitation, the jurisdiction, of history. In history, what is past is dead. But the Pastimes of the Lord are eternal, nitya, always present. Every līlā is eternally present; He can show Himself in His eternal forms simultaneously. So in His past, present, and future, all events are simultaneously occurring. When He enters the arena of Kaṁsa, different groups are seeing Him in different ways. What is seen by one section of people is seen differently by another, according to their own nature. Even the blind can see Him if He wills. If He wills to show Himself to anyone, though blind, one can see Him clearly, because these eyes of flesh are not necessary to see Him. By His willpower alone He can reveal Himself to any person. That was the case with Dhṛtarāṣṭra in the Kuru sabhā.

We are accustomed to think: “This is good, this is bad”, and “this is possible, this is impossible”. We are accustomed to such considerations within our rules of thought.

But ultimately the possibility of free action is not taken away from us at any stage; even if we are reduced to the level of taking birth as a tree, there also, the freedom is within. It is hard to think that a tree has got independence, free will, but it is there, in a suppressed position. Freedom is within us also, and we may try as far as possible to understand how it is so. But our freedom is also covered by so many conditions that we may think we are not free but are forced by circumstances. But still, we are free for our selection of any path, good or bad.

It came about in this way. Devahūti was married to the sage Kardama Ṛṣi. After passing some years in the enjoyment of married life, Devahūti conceived a child in her womb from the ṛṣi. In <span class=\\"e3\\">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the Lord says: “<span class=\\"e3\\">Prajanaś chāsmi kandarpaḥ</span>: of Cupids, I am He who ensures progeny.” And elsewhere it is said, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Prajanāya na rataye</span>: married life is not meant for enjoyment, but for the purpose of producing good progeny.” So, when the objective of their marriage was achieved, the ṛṣi proposed that he retire from married life. He told Devahūti, “You have a child in your womb, and it is not an ordinary child; the Lord Himself is coming. So I am going to live alone for my own higher purpose of life.” Then Devahūti said, “I have such a good partner; I am fortunate to have a saint like you as my husband, but I did not take advantage of your noble personality to learn anything about Brahma, about the Lord, about my inner life’s necessity and its fulfilment. I did not inquire about that. I was only busy to serve you, to satisfy your desires. Though I had such a noble companion, I did not utilise my fortune. Now I pray that you may stay for some time and teach me, help me in spiritual life, and then you may go.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Kardama Ṛṣi said, “You will get help from your son. It is the Lord Himself who is coming, not an ordinary child. Remember this, and in time you will receive that spiritual help from Him. So I won’t stay.

Because of her great motherly affection, however, as her son grew, she gradually forgot what her husband had revealed: that He was not an ordinary child."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the course of time, when the boy had grown and was one day absorbed, Devahūti was reminded, “Oh, the mood of my child does not seem to be ordinary.” She could understand that He was engaged in deep thought, and considered: “His father foretold that the Lord would appear through me, and now I see it is true. My son’s mood does not seem to be worldly, but it is from above. His mind is absorbed in transcendental thought.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" She then slowly approached Him: “Child, your father told me that You are not an ordinary boy of this world. You are divine.

That is his conclusion. The nyāyikas (logicians) say that there must be One who has created this world. This world has been created, so there must be someone who has done it.

But the atheistic Kapila says, “No, there is no necessity of any God to explain the existence of this material world: Īśvar-asiddhe. His finding, his conclusion, is that there is no necessity of a creator; automatically everything exists. Only two things are necessary: first, a particle of spirit, and second, matter.

Then there is the mental world, the manifestation of the mental energy: “I want this, I do not want that; I like this, I don’t like that.” And, the intelligence gives direction to the mind: “Don’t take this, take that.” But it is all within the ahaṅkār, material ego.

The soul is ‘crippled’; he cannot move, but he can see. The blind man is the commander of the energy, who can move here and there; he can carry, but he is blind.

The upper side is eternal, it is sat-chit-ānanda, eternal, conscious, and happy; and here: asat, achit, nirānanda. It is asat, flickering, every minute it is dying; and achit, unconscious; and nirānanda, with no feeling of joy or happiness. These are the respective natures of this world, and of that world. And if we want to have association with that world, we are told that in the highest position there is infinite beauty, love, and ecstasy. That world can come down to us, and we can be taken in as one of the Lord’s own family members. We can live as a family member with the highest Entity of that world! Mahāprabhu told us it is possible, but only through affection, and not by knowledge or any mystic realisation.

He later left the state, but that girl was left on the outskirts of some village or town, and there she gave birth to a child who was a great devotee. It was a very peculiar thing: the girl was also a devotee, but somehow she had to undergo such a horrible experience. She gave birth to a child, and he lived on the outskirts of that town. When he grew up, he used to cook khichuri, that is, rice and beans cooked together, boiled into a half-liquid consistency, and he used to offer that to Jagannāth from afar. By dint of his devotion, Jagannāth had to go there and accept that khichuri offering."},{"class":"b44","text":" One day the boy was perhaps late in his offering. Jagannāth took the khichuri, but the time was then late for the temple offering, so He had to run back to install Himself in His position in the temple, and a particle of that khichuri was on His lips. The pāṇḍās, the pūjārīs (the priestly class), noticed: “What is this? How has this happened? We can detect this is not the proper offering to Jagannāth. How is it here on His lips?” So it was referred to the leader of the pāṇḍās, and he also searched, but he could not ascertain the cause. Then it was taken to the king, and he also investigated it, “Who has taken this food and smeared it on the mouth of Jagannāth?”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Finally the priest who had been in charge at the time of the offering of food in the temple was apprehended: “You are responsible! You were in charge of the temple at the time of Jagannāth’s offering, then how has this impure thing come in His mouth? You must explain, or you will be punished.” The man was innocent, and he said, “I do not know anything. I do not know anything!”"},{"class":"b44","text":" Then, when he was about to be punished, Jagannāth came in a dream to the king as well as to the leading priest: “That man is innocent. Don’t disturb him. On the outskirts of the town is My devotee. He offered that food to Me, and I ate it, but the time was late, and I had to hurry back to occupy My position in the temple, so My mouth was not cleansed. This is the name of that boy. He is living there. He is My devotee, and I have taken this food there.” And it was as a result of the Mohammedan’s exploitation of the princess that this devotee appeared. So, Kṛṣṇa-bhakti, devotion to Kṛṣṇa, does not care for the formality of purity or impurity by any worldly considerations. It is independent."},{"class":"b44","text":" Kṛṣṇa-bhakti is so powerful and does not care for anything. Jagannāth accepted the offering of that boy who was considered to have the worst fate, a cursed fate.

But his offering attracted Jagannāth so much."},{"class":"b44","text":" So, love is wonderfully above everything, surpassing all. Mahāprabhu asked us to accept the path of love, which means giving one’s heart, one’s self. It is so powerful, nothing else can attract Kṛṣṇa. He is very greedy to eat this love, this prema. He lives on prema. He is the Lord of love. That love has its inner existence. It is the inner existence of all of us. He is love personified, and there is a tinge within us also.

Śrīdhar Paṇḍit had a well, and nearby an iron pot which he used for drawing water. Mahāprabhu began to drink water from the well with that pot, which had been left outside. All the devotees objected, “What are You doing? This pot is always kept outside and is very dirty. We are bringing a clean pot for Your drinking water!” Mahāprabhu ignored them and continued drinking water from that iron pot.

Kṛṣṇa wants that, and not any external formality of the civilised or non-civilised world. In the case of Lord Rāmachandra also, we see that although in the highest consideration He is the director of moral laws, nīti, He could not contain Himself when offered something with devotion by an ‘untouchable’ lady. And that was after she had first taken it herself, after she had taken some sweet. Whatever remained that she considered most tasteful, she kept for Rāma, and He accepted it."},{"class":"b44","text":" There is another incident that happened in Vidura’s house. While Vidura was out collecting alms, Kṛṣṇa suddenly appeared as a guest at his house. Vidura’s wife received Him, but there was nothing to offer, only some bananas. So after seating Him nicely she gave Him that, but she was offering the banana peels to Kṛṣṇa and discarding the fruit on the ground. She was so bewildered, overwhelmed by the joy of finding that Kṛṣṇa was suddenly present in her house, that she was discarding the fruit and giving Him the peels, and He was eating them."},{"class":"b51","text":" At that very moment Nārad and Vidura arrived. Vidura exclaimed: “What are you doing? You are leaving the fruit and giving the peels to my Lord!” But Nārad came to her relief: “She is bewildered, but He who is eating is not at all disturbed! One might think that He would say, ‘Oh, give Me the fruit. Why are you giving Me the peels?’ But He is eating without any concern.” Then Kṛṣṇa answered, “I am eating neither the fruit nor the peels, but I am eating that which is devotion! I am accepting her devotion. Neither the peel nor the fruit can satisfy Me. I need neither the one nor the other, but I live on devotion, Nārad.”"},{"class":"b59","text":" patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayachchhati<br />tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Bhagavad-gītā: 9.26)"},{"class":"b43","text":" The Lord says, “I accept all those foodstuffs that are offered; but actually it is not the food itself that I take, rather it is the purpose behind that offering, the ideal.

That is because they do not know anything, so they can be taught easily; but the others who had some knowledge of music had to pay double, because everything which they had previously learned would first have to be forgotten, and only then would they be allowed to start learning in the proper way.

In kaniṣṭha-adhikār, in the lower stage, one does not concern himself with the stage of his progress, or if he is getting devotion or not; with a peaceful mind he is engaged in archan (Deity worship), or whatever may be his service.

I can’t manage Him!” In this way there is struggle, but that is produced by yogamāyā. It is in prema-bhakti, ahi bhāvati premṇā, and it is dynamic in character, not static.

It is arranged not by mahāmāyā, but by yogamāyā. It is carrying us to the centre. The very land there is of rasa. It is rasamaya, full of sweet taste, the land of nectar, amṛtamaya-loka.

But entering Vaikuṇṭha, again there is life, movement, and that is for service. In dāsya-rasa there is activity, there is struggle. They are serving the order: “Do this, go here, give this to them.” There is so much movement, and movement means struggle, but that struggle gives peace. That kind of struggle begins in dāsya-rasa. And śānta-rasa is the marginal position, and in that position of non-activity there is also peace, but it is of a lower quality:"},{"class":"b59","text":" ātmārāmāś cha munayo nirgranthā apy urukrame<br />kurvanty ahaitukīṁ bhaktim ittham-bhūta-guṇo hariḥ"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad Bhāgavatam: 1.7.10)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “All varieties of ātmārāmas (those who take pleasure in the ātmā or spiritual self), especially those established on the path of self-realisation, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, desire to render unalloyed devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead. This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including even liberated souls.”"},{"class":"b51","text":" That is the marginal position, it is only on the threshold of service proper:"},{"class":"b59","text":" brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā\\u2028na śochati na kāṅkṣati\\u2028<br />samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu\\u2028mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Bhagavad-gītā: 18.54)"},{"class":"b43","text":" “The spotlessly pure-hearted and self-satisfied soul who has attained to his conscious divine nature neither grieves, nor craves for anything. Seeing all beings equally (in the conception of My supreme energy), he gradually achieves supreme devotion, prema-bhakti, unto Me.”"},{"class":"b44","text":" So the marginal position is a position of so-called peace. But we find dynamic peace in struggle, as it appears externally in dāsya-, sakhya-, and vātsalya-rasas, and in madhura-rasa and its sub-divisions, svakīya and parakīya. Suppose the madhura-rasa servitors are to meet with Kṛṣṇa on a dark night in the forest. On the surface it appears they have to struggle in so many ways. Being given the sign, hearing the particular flute-song of Kṛṣṇa, they will have to pass through the jungle to be somewhere at a particular time. That appears like an ordinary struggle, but it is the sweetest movement."},{"class":"b44","text":" If ‘struggle’ means ‘movement,’ then there, on that plane, where movement is so sweet, struggle is a high thing. But if we think that struggle means something painful, then that struggle must be of the lower plane. Here it is pain-producing. All movement, all endeavour here produces only pain. On the higher plane, there is also movement, but that movement produces sweetness, just as sandalwood when rubbed produces a sweet scent. There is struggle for the purpose of producing sweetness."},{"class":"b51","text":" So there on the highest level they are also very busily struggling, but that struggle is producing nectar, which they are tasting. To struggle also means to be busy. Everyone there is so busy, more than we can ever conceive. They are so active, but their activity is not painful. It produces peace. Here, trying to do away with our unholy attraction to the mundane, we experience a painful struggle. But, as the English poet Shelley wrote: “Our sweetest songs tell of saddest thought.” That kind of struggle also gives us peace. When a beginner in devotion starts to become detached from his mundane environment, to leave it is painful, but he also gets a kind of peace:"},{"class":"b59","text":" yad anucharita-līlā-karṇa-pīyūṣa-vipruṭ-<br />sakṛd-adana-vidhūta-dvandva-dharmā vinaṣṭāḥ<br />sapadi gṛha-kuṭumbaṁ dīnā utsṛjya dīnā\\u2028<br />bahava iha vihaṅgā bhikṣu-charyāṁ charanti"},{"class":"b54","text":" (Śrīmad Bhāgavatam: 10.47.18)"},{"class":"b43","text":" A devotee leaves his family, and his family is crying and wailing. He also feels pain because of their anguish. But still he feels a kind of peace of a higher quality, so he can bear the apparent pain of separation from his family life. When he is giving up his home and his family, he feels some painful reaction, but beyond that, in his heart of hearts, he feels some bright prospect. When a man goes to a foreign country to earn some money, he leaves his family, and so he feels some pain, but at heart he also realises that he is going to bring in money which will satisfy him, and enable him to enjoy."},{"class":"b44","text":" In a similar way, when a person goes to leave this world, his association with misconception, apparently, or outwardly, he feels pain on account of what he is doing, but at heart he gets some hope of a bright future, and with that strength he can go on. So, when we have some attraction for this mischievous world, and we try to leave it, at that stage we struggle—a painful struggle. But still, beyond that we see a bright hope of some unparalleled nectarean taste of life."},{"class":"b44","text":" So struggle does not always mean pain. Up to a certain stage it is painful, and that is due to māyā, misconception. And we find also the symptoms of pain in Kṛṣṇa-līlā, but that is not really pain. It is apparent pain; it only seems so. Kṛṣṇa said that He would come to a particular kuñja (forest bower), and Rādhārāṇī with Her party went there, but He did not come. That is called kalahāntaritā, mistiming, that is, being let down by the lover or beloved. And there are so many other situations, like māna (jealousy), and so on. All these things are painful, but as Kṛṣṇadās Kavirāj Goswāmī writes, describing Kṛṣṇa-prema, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Bāhye viṣa-jvālā haya, bhitare ānanda-maya</span>: externally there appears to be great pain, but the heart is overflowing with blissfulness.” So, “Our sweetest songs are those which tell of saddest thought.” Externally it is sad, but internally, it is sweet. It is like that."},{"class":"b44","text":" When we take the Name, in the beginning we think it our duty to count so many rounds, and sometimes it is painful. But when we get a taste for the Name, then our inner tendency incites us to take the Name more and more—not that as a duty we will somehow have to finish sixteen rounds. But when we acquire ruchi, inner taste for that particular service, it is happy. Until and unless we acquire that position, there must be some pain."},{"class":"b52","text":" As long as we do not have that taste, and we are doing that service as a duty, we will feel some pain. So sādhana-daśā is a little painful, on the whole. Then in āpan-daśā it becomes sweet. Underground, of course, sweetness is everywhere; otherwise why should a person be tempted to approach the spiritual path? Only for the hope of sweetness. But still, if we want to see by analysis, then the process is śravaṇ-daśā, hearing; then varaṇ-daśā, accepting; then sādhana-daśā, practising. Up to this point it is a little painful. Then āpan-daśā, realised devotion, and finally prapanna-daśā, full self-surrender. And what pain exists is only apparent. Substantially it is all sweet."}]},{"title":"Heart and Halo","paragraphs":[{"class":"b46","text":"\\r"},{"class":"b91","text":" Chapter Seven"},{"class":"b95","text":" Heart and Halo"},{"class":"b43","text":" The prejudice of our past experience, caught within us in a subtle form, has covered, like dust, the eye of our soul. Our inner vision is densely covered with the dust of many different misconceptions of separate interest, causing us to ignore the universal interest."},{"class":"b44","text":" This mental cover is made up of the prejudices of local and provincial interest, and it keeps us from seeing reality. <span class=\\"e3\\">Viṣaya-dhūlite kemane se para-tattva pāiye dekhite</span>: how will a person be able to read the universal wave when his mind is fully engrossed with local interest of different kinds? How can one detect the universal interest, the universal wave? Only one who has fully eliminated all kinds of local interest, and is eager to understand the universal wave, can see it clearly."},{"class":"b44","text":" <span class=\\"e3\\">Artheṣv abhijñaḥ svarāṭ</span>: what is the purpose of the movement of this world? The answer is clear: “For itself”. Reality is for itself. It is not there to satisfy many, but to satisfy One. All the waves are meant to satisfy that One, and if we can put ourselves on that level, we can understand the truth. Otherwise, we are all cheaters."},{"class":"b44","text":" We are far from the truth when we cannot see that everything, all waves, are flowing towards the satisfaction of one: Svayam Bhagavān. We are labouring under a deception. We are deceivers who are not just deceiving ourselves but the world also. We are guilty of misunderstanding everything and of carrying that false knowledge to others. Everyone, all the baddha jīvas, are more or less cheaters. That is our position, and we must be relieved of such misunderstanding, such deception of our own self, as well as of the environment, if we are to be placed in our proper position."},{"class":"b44","text":" Then we can go there and find that universal wave, see it: darśan. Darśan means ‘to see’, and how to see, that must be learned. What to see, how to read what is going on, in myself and outside, that is proper understanding and proper education. A proper understanding of one’s own self and also of the environment is proper education. Education must be Vedic. The standard must be drawn from outside this area of māyā, misunderstanding. It must be drawn from the perfect realm through Veda, revealed truth."},{"class":"b44","text":" We must accept revealed truth and bid farewell to so-called scientific knowledge and other kinds of perceptions, which are all erroneous, based on false experience and false information. “It belongs to me; it belongs to him; it belongs to them”: this calculation is all false. So we have to be relieved. We have to get wholesale relief from this mania, this misconception. And not only must we get relief from the misconception, from misunderstanding the external waves, but we must attain a positive position, to learn to understand the wave, the vibration of Goloka. Goloka is the most universal, most fundamental plane, and if we can harmonise ourselves with that plane, we will be led to Vṛndāvan, or Nabadwīp, and there we shall see things as they are."},{"class":"b44","text":" Some are more attracted to Kṛṣṇa-līlā, others more towards Nabadwīp-līlā, and others have an inclination to be accommodated in both places. In Kṛṣṇa-līlā also some are attracted to Rādhārāṇī’s camp, some to Kṛṣṇa’s camp, and some are holding the middle position. We find this sort of division, and that is necessary for the līlā, by the arrangement of yogamāyā. So, in the highest plane, we find two kinds of Pastimes, Kṛṣṇa-līlā and Gaura-līlā, and they are of the same value. In one there is transaction within a ‘limited’ camp, and in the other there is transaction, along with a tendency towards distribution to others. But they are of the same value. That which is being distributed, and that which is being enjoyed are of one and the same value of ecstasy, sweetness, love, and beauty. Some are more attracted to the one līlā, some to the other."},{"class":"b44","text":" Within Gaura-līlā also, we find those like Narahari Sarkār and his followers, who were more given to Kṛṣṇa than Gaurāṅga, and others who are more inclined towards Gaurāṅga than to Kṛṣṇa. This is all by the grant of the Lord, the supreme will—His līlā."},{"class":"b44","text":" In Gaura-līlā, Gadādhar Paṇḍit is holding the helm. Everything belongs to him, still he has to admit he’s dispossessed, that Gaurāṅga has taken everything! He is exhaustively dedicated to Gaurāṅga. So Śrīla Kavirāj Goswāmī says, “<span class=\\"e3\\">Te̐ho lakṣmī-rūpā, tā̐ra sama keha nāi</span>: he represents the main potency of Gaurāṅga, and no one is to be compared with him.” This is the conclusion of Śrīla Kavirāj Goswāmī about Śrī Gadādhar. He is Gaura-premamaya, the embodiment of Śrī Gaura’s love."},{"class":"b44","text":" Gadādhar Dās represents the halo of Rādhārāṇī, but Gadādhar Paṇḍit represents Her mood, Her nature—Her heart.<span class=\\"e13\\">5</span> It is as if Mahāprabhu has taken away Gadādhar Paṇḍit’s soul, and the body is still standing! That is the position of Gadādhar Paṇḍit. He is quite empty, and following Mahāprabhu. He is not full in himself. Something, the most important thing, his heart, has been taken by Mahāprabhu, so he has no other alternative but to follow Him. He is wholly given to Mahāprabhu. Gadādhar Paṇḍit’s position, the part he played, was something like that of Rādhārāṇī, Her heart stolen by Kṛṣṇa, the empty body still standing. <span class=\\"e3\\">Rādhā-bhāva-dyuti-suvalitaṁ naumi Kṛṣṇa-svarūpam</span>: He was fully engrossed in the conception of Śrī Gaurāṅga. Gaurāṅga had taken everything from him, so he had no other alternative. He was fully engrossed, captured completely by Him."},{"class":"b44","text":" We find his activity throughout his whole life was like this. Of the other devotees, some were ordered to go to Vṛndāvan, and some were allowed to go there, but though Gadādhar Paṇḍit wanted to visit Vṛndāvan with Mahāprabhu Himself, he was denied: “No, you won’t go.” When Jagadānanda Paṇḍit asked to go there, Mahāprabhu, with hesitation, granted him permission, “Yes, go there, but move always under the guidance of Rūpa and Sanātan.” He also gave him some special instructions: “Do this, and this, and don’t do that.” But Gadādhar Paṇḍit was not allowed to go there."},{"class":"b44","text":" He was the representation of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī Herself, yet his peculiar position was such: the Queen of Vṛndāvan, but now transferred to Nabadwīp. His position had become just the opposite; he could not enter Vṛndāvan! He prayed for permission, but Mahāprabhu did not give it. He said, “No, stay and live here.” And he had to do so. Śrī Gadādhar Paṇḍit represents the predominated moiety of the Whole. The Whole consists of predominating and predominated moieties, and he represents the predominated half. He is one half of the Absolute Truth."},{"class":"b44","text":" In the teachings of Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, whose preaching was inspired by Śrī Gadādhar Paṇḍit and Śrīman Mahāprabhu, we also find all the substance that is present in that plane of vibration. These two personalities, Śrī Gadādhar Paṇḍit and Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, are our great Gurus, our guides, and by offering our worship to them we can sow the seed of our highest benefit. By the grace of that great Guru Mahārāj Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Goswāmī Prabhupād, we have been able to understand this."},{"class":"b44","text":" And Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur, though generally he has his own position, as understood from the consideration of the disciple, Prabhupād Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākur has seen Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī in him: a ‘relative’ vision. He once said that Rādhārāṇī represents the full play of aṣṭa-nāyikā, the eight characteristics of the heroine, and we see that they are all perfectly represented in Her. In other places we may find partial representations of them, but we find them fully manifest only in Her."},{"class":"b44","text":" He said, “I see my Gurudev as Guṇa Mañjarī, and in that mañjarī form he has some partial representation of Rādhārāṇī. But if I attempt to look more deeply, I find him identified fully with Her. The eight kinds of qualities displayed in the service of Kṛṣṇa (aṣṭa-nāyikā) are to be found there. If I look at him with my head a little more erect, I can see that he is one with Rādhārāṇī. ‘<span class=\\"e3\\">Āchāryaṁ Māṁ vijānīyāt</span>: know the Āchārya as Myself.’ If I give more attention to this śāstric rule and try to search out the meaning, I find that Rādhārāṇī comes to take Her place there, in the position of my Gurudev.” In this way he has seen in Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur the fullest representation of the cult of Śrī Gaurāṅga."},{"class":"b51","text":" This realisation is expressed in his poem where he says that he saw Svarūp Dāmodar Goswāmī in Gaura Kiśor Dās Bābājī, and Śrī Gadādhar Paṇḍit in Śrīla Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur.

In another place, in his poem at the conclusion of his <span class=\\"e3\\">Śrī Chaitanya-charitāmṛta</span> commentary, he has written: “Here, in Nabadwīp Dhām, the eternal Pastimes are going on continuously.

Sometimes it is suppressed, and sometimes it is appearing on the surface. In that plane all is going on by the sweet will of Śrī Gaurāṅga, without any restriction.
